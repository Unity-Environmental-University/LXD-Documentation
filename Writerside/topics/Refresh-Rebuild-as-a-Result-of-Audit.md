# Refresh/Rebuild as a Result of Audit

The decision to refresh or rebuild a course should take place at regular intervals to ensure previously developed courses still meet our design standards. 

A New Build involves creating a course that has never been offered. This includes a visioning of the course, creation of course outcomes and weekly objectives aligned with the program learning outcomes, selection of materials, creation of content, creation of assessments and rubrics aligned with the course outcomes and weekly objectives, full design and delivery of the course, etc. 

A course Rebuild involves making changes to “major” curricular elements of the course content or delivery. This includes: entirely new key assessment; new course concept or focus (may be in response to changes in the field, such as DSM IV being replaced by DSM-5); re-alignment of course to new programmatic learning outcomes; changes made to a “substantial” portion of the course. 

Due to the scope of the changes, a course Rebuild is typically equivalent to, or even more substantial than, the workload of a New Build. It may also mean starting over from scratch. That is sometimes easier than trying to salvage pieces of a course. However, this does not mean you can’t use assignments and learning materials from the old course. 

Thus, the processes for a Rebuild and a New Build are the same, but they use different templates which can be found in the Course Development Resources Folder.

- The Course Project is usually discussed in the Kick-Off Meeting. Roles and deadlines are assigned to those involved in the process. 
- Involved Parties: Dean, Learning Experience Designers (LXDs), Learning Technology Support Specialist (LTSS), a Subject Matter Expert (SME), XR specialist

If a course has recently been refreshed, please make sure to let instructors know when sending Update Section(s) Ready notification. If the instructor has taught the course before, give some specifics about what has changed.
