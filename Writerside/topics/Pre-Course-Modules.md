# Pre-Course Modules

Some courses have “pre-course” modules that students must complete before the start of the term. These instructions will live in the Course Overview Module or in an additional Module at the beginning of the course. Depending on the course, this module may be available weeks before the course begins.
## Course Examples

- GISC 101 & 505: Introductory courses require students to download software. 
- ARTS 101: Students must ensure they have proper equipment (cameras, lenses, software). 
- XR classes: May require students to acquire XR technology up to 3 weeks before the start of the course.
