# Updating a Syllabus

There is a standard syllabus at Unity College. This template syllabus is found in the [dev_template](https://unity.instructure.com/courses/3850558/assignments/syllabus) in the Distance Education Development subaccount of Canvas.

The main areas to update on a syllabus are:

* Course term
* Information on the Trello Card Update Checklist
    * Accommodation Language
    * Communication Policies
    * Grading/Rubrics
    * Announcements
    * Etc. 
* The syllabus should list the course outcomes in a numbered list for easier reference to each outcome.
* The textbook should be listed, or if one is not used, then the pre-existing text regarding open access resources should be left.
* The Week 1 Learning Materials preview should include all Week 1 resources as a bulleted list and the Week 1 Lecture and Course Project Overview Videos.
