# Video Editing &amp; Audio Syncing

Video Editing / Audio Syncing
SMEs will occasionally submit/upload videos where the first few seconds are them getting set up and/or someone saying “action”, or another issue where audio and video do not align.

For simple edits, see the instructions in the next section.

For videos requiring audio/video syncing or other more complicated edits, IDs can use Adobe Premier (available to you with your Unity email) to re-sync the audio and video or perform other edits.

Open Adobe Premier. This is a video editing software, so you may have to close other programs so that your computer is not substantially slowed down.

To begin, click File new project in the top left corner.
Download the SME’s video files from Drive or an email.
Premier is good at staging multiple videos in one project, so you can import or drag all of the videos into Premier instead of making individual projects. The project file name should be the course name, e.g. GISC520. Each week should be its own sequence, so down in the video editing area, name the first sequence “Week 1” and press Ctrl+N to create a new sequence, which you can name by the different Weeks (or other course video elements, if needed).

To edit the video, look at the lock icons next to video (on top) and audio (bottom). If you try to edit anything, this action will cut, move, or modify both elements. We likely want to cut audio and slide it back in relation to video by about a second. Lock the video bar so you can work exclusively on the audio. You can drag this or cut out silent portions to align the audio with the video. It may take some time figuring out exactly how much to move it. Quality check the rest of the video to make sure the audio/video is synced throughout. You can then unlock the video at the end.
You might want to edit the beginning or end of the video (and audio) clip if it lingers for too long, so as to eliminate the awkward few seconds at the end (hunting for the stop button) or getting set up to record.
To finish editing the video, add transitions to beginning and end by clicking ctrl+d. This adds cross fades to beginning and end of the clip for a smoother beginning and ending.

For some videos, the audio is already normalized pretty close to zero so that the sound is generally even. To check, right click, select audio gain, click normalize peaks to 0, which will normalize everything so that the loudest noise in that sequence will top out at 0 db (where you want it to be). You could normalize all peaks, but assess the video if the peaks are relatively similar and don’t need this process performed.

To finish working on a sequence, go to File export media
Keep the video format as H264, set the Preset - adaptive medium bit rate. This will make file size smaller with a little less quality, but it will process faster on youtube. If the videos are just of a SME talking, this is fine. However, if the video has a lot of detail (such as slides or diagrams), you may want to keep a higher quality video.
If at office (or you have very fast wifi at home), the video setting of youtube 1080p HD is fine (the file size is 6 times larger but will upload quickly on office wifi).
At the bottom of the export list, click queue instead of export if working on multiple videos (export works fine for just one video).
Clicking “queue” will pull up the Adobe creative cloud media encoder, which by queueing you can have all the videos set up and ready to export at once. This is recommended since it will slow down your computer to process these videos, so it is best done while taking a break (such as lunch or a walk!). Click play and export in sequence
Once one video is set up in the queue you can download/import the other weeks in their labeled sequences. Drag the video into the week 2 tab. When dragged “change sequence setting” will change to adapt to the video you dragged in → matches up the ratio of the frame, type of format, everything. Edit this and other videos as necessary.
In adobe media encoder, hit “play” to export them, then upload to the Unity DE Youtube channel.

Possible recommendations to SME regarding video/audio out of sync:
What are they using to record their video?
Exporting as a .mov (apples/premier hate .mov files) or other file?
Are they exporting .mov to .mp4 or changing a file format?
Troubleshooting after one video may prevent having to edit multiple videos with the same issue.

Editing a Video with Youtube
If you simply need to trim parts of the video, you can use Youtube. Follow these instructions.
CaptionSync (Verbit)
All videos used for learning purposes within a course should be transcribed with CaptionSync. We have one account for this site:
Login: drogers, PW: Distance#1

Login and click “Continue”
Click Caption/Transcribe.
Click “New List of URLs for Transcription”.
Type a course code (i.e. EVPC 401).
Select the “No rush 4-day” option.
Go to the embedded learning materials videos within Canvas and click on the title in the top left corner to go to the playlist.
Copy the url for each video and paste it into the submission box in CaptionSync.
Paste videos underneath each other with an “enter” line break.
Click “Process list as a batch using List Description”. This will assign the videos you’ve submitted to the course code (i.e. EVPC 401).
Check back in 4 business days to download the zip file of transcripts, then upload them to the corresponding learning material pages in Canvas
Click on Caption/Transcribe to expand the menu
Click on “Batch Status”

Copying a Playlist URL to CaptionSync
To quickly add videos from a course playlist, visit this website: http://www.williamsportwebdeveloper.com/FavBackUp.aspx.
Copy the unique playlist code.
Go to the YouTube playlist.
Copy the code string after ?list= (for example: PLZCz70q-Ni-ZeOWn9pMxB-UkZHvgQJY0E).
Click submit.
Click “Yes” in the Excel warning box.
Copy the list of video URLs from the Excel document and paste them into CaptionSync.
Check a couple of videos to make sure the copy was correct and successful.
Complete the CaptionSync process as described above.

Note: When you check on the status of a transcription, if Captionsync gives you the message “Not Ingested”, there is a good chance someone already submitted the video for processing before you.  Use the “search” field in Captionsync to look for the course name or video name.  You should still be able to access the previously processed material.  
Transcripts in Canvas
CaptionSync Website
Upload the transcripts from Captionsync to the development folder in Google.
Then, upload them as a .txt to Files in Canvas.
Select “Transcript” under the video and link it to the file within Canvas.
Do not link to the transcript in GoogleDocs.
Select “class=” in the HTML and delete it before the inserted file so it doesn’t have the download symbol.
Click “save” and verify the transcript is uploaded
Adding Transcripts to YouTube
Before adding subtitles to Youtube, download the captions from CaptionSync as clean.txt files and save them to your desktop
Go to YouTube
Switch to the Unity College Distance Education account in the top right corner of Youtube
Click “library” in the left hand column
Scroll down to Playlists and click “show more”
Click on the Playlist for the course you want to add subtitles to
The first video in the playlist will play. Click pause.
You will see the videos from the playlist on the right.
Right click on the video you want to add subtitles to. Open it in another tab
Subtitles are added to videos one by one
Repeat the following for each video:
Click “edit” below the video
Scroll down to “Subtitles” in the left hand column
Click “Add Language”
