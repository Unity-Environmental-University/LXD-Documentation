# Video Editing &amp; Audio Syncing

SMEs will occasionally submit/upload videos where the first few seconds are them getting set up and/or someone saying “action”, or another issue where audio and video do not align.

*For simple edits, see the instructions in the next section.*

For videos requiring audio/video syncing or other more complicated edits, Learning Technology Support Specialists can use Adobe Premiere (available to you with your Unity email) to re-sync the audio and video or perform other edits.

**How-To:**

1. Open Adobe Premiere. This is a video editing software, so you may have to close other programs so that your computer is not substantially slowed down. 
2. To begin, click File new project in the top left corner. 
3. Download the SME’s video files from Drive or an email. 
4. Premier is good at staging multiple videos in one project, so you can import or drag all of the videos into Premier instead of making individual projects. 
5. The project file name should be the course name, e.g. GISC520.
6. Each week should be its own sequence, so down in the video editing area, name the first sequence “Week 1” and press Ctrl+N to create a new sequence, which you can name by the different Weeks (or other course video elements, if needed).

**To edit the video:**
1. Look at the lock icons next to video (on top) and audio (bottom). If you try to edit anything, this action will cut, move, or modify both elements. We likely want to cut audio and slide it back in relation to video by about a second. Lock the video bar so you can work exclusively on the audio. You can drag this or cut out silent portions to align the audio with the video. It may take some time figuring out exactly how much to move it. Quality check the rest of the video to make sure the audio/video is synced throughout. You can then unlock the video at the end. 
2. You might want to edit the beginning or end of the video (and audio) clip if it lingers for too long, so as to eliminate the awkward few seconds at the end (hunting for the stop button) or getting set up to record. 
3. To finish editing the video, add transitions to beginning and end by clicking ctrl+d. This adds cross fades to beginning and end of the clip for a smoother beginning and ending.

4. For some videos, the audio is already normalized pretty close to zero so that the sound is generally even. To check, right click, select audio gain, click normalize peaks to 0, which will normalize everything so that the loudest noise in that sequence will top out at 0 db (where you want it to be). You could normalize all peaks, but assess the video if the peaks are relatively similar and don’t need this process performed.

**To finish working on a sequence:** 
1. Go to File export media 
2. Keep the video format as H264, set the Preset - adaptive medium bit rate. This will make file size smaller with a little less quality, but it will process faster on youtube. If the videos are just of a SME talking, this is fine. However, if the video has a lot of detail (such as slides or diagrams), you may want to keep a higher quality video. 
3. If at office (or you have very fast wifi at home), the video setting of youtube 1080p HD is fine (the file size is 6 times larger but will upload quickly on office wifi). 
4. At the bottom of the export list, click queue instead of export if working on multiple videos (export works fine for just one video). 
5. Clicking “queue” will pull up the Adobe creative cloud media encoder, which by queueing you can have all the videos set up and ready to export at once. This is recommended since it will slow down your computer to process these videos, so it is best done while taking a break (such as lunch or a walk!). Click play and export in sequence 
6. Once one video is set up in the queue you can download/import the other weeks in their labeled sequences. Drag the video into the week 2 tab. When dragged “change sequence setting” will change to adapt to the video you dragged in → matches up the ratio of the frame, type of format, everything. Edit this and other videos as necessary. 
7. In adobe media encoder, hit “play” to export them, then upload to the Unity DE Youtube channel.

**Considerations regarding video/audio out of sync:**
- What are they using to record their video? 
- Are they exporting as a .mov (apples/premier hate .mov files) or other file? 
- Are they exporting .mov to .mp4 or changing a file format? 
- Troubleshooting after one video may prevent having to edit multiple videos with the same issue.

**Editing a Video with Youtube**
- If you simply need to trim parts of the video, you can use Youtube. [Follow these instructions.](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9057455?hl=en)
