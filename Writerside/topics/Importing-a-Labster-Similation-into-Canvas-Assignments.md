## Input the Labster simulation into the assignment
Note: When designing the lab course with the SME, be sure to note the full title and links of each lab simulation you will be completing. Some have very similar names and/or content, so it is best to confirm with the SME so you have all the correct simulations.
Click on the assignment and then click “edit”
