# Using Turnitin in Canvas

> Files uploaded to Turnitin must be in Word Doc or PDF format only (no Apple Pages documents). Integration Capabilities: Can be used with Canvas Outcomes, Peer Review, and Groups.
#  Workflow:

The workflow remains the same for students with a minor addition (a checkbox).
When assessing matched similarity, give students the benefit of the doubt. Intentional text manipulations are flagged.

**Setting Up an Assignment:**

1. Create an assignment in Canvas. 
2. Attach Turnitin to the assignment. 
3. Include language in the syllabus or other relevant places informing students that assignments are being submitted via Turnitin. 
4. Choose submission type: Online. 
5. Options include text entry, file upload, or both (no Google Docs link). 
> Note: Turnitin does not integrate with Discussion boards.
   Students will receive a notification if they submit a file type that cannot be checked for plagiarism (e.g., an image).
  
6. Use as formative assessment: Allow multiple attempts and revisions after initial submission. 
7. Select Turnitin for plagiarism review. 
8. Exclude bibliographic materials but consider including quotes for matching.
9. Index submissions to add students' work to the repository. 
10. Configure similarity report settings to run immediately and on the due date. 
11. Determine when to show similarity report to students: Immediate, after grading, after the due date, or never. Immediate is recommended for formative assessments. 
12. Understand how group assignments work: Collaborative submissions might still get flagged, but similarity scores should not be solely relied upon. 
13. Copy and Back-up originality reports. 
14. Wait 90 seconds between setting up and submitting the assignment.
   
**Submission Process:** Students upload their assignment and must agree to a declaration.

**Viewing Originality Report:**

1. Go to "Grades" in Canvas. 
2. Click on the color indicator to view the originality report. 
3. Exclusions can be made, such as excluding the essay prompt. 
4. Click "Share" to create a PDF of the similarity report for student improvement. 
5. Use the question mark icon for additional details or help.

## Instructor Perspective:

Access the originality report through "Grades" or "Speedgrader."
A color scale indicates the level of similarity (0 matches to 75% and up).
Instructors can view previous submissions and percentage changes in similarity reports. Feedback and comments are provided via Speedgrader, with rubrics attached.

**Understanding Similarity Reports:**

*Text similarity vs. Plagiarism:* Differentiate between unintentional matches and deliberate plagiarism.

*No fixed threshold for similarity percentage:* Interpretation varies based on assignment type and format.
Exclude specific text or view all sources where the text appears.
Adjust settings for Small Matches to control word count of similar words.

**Policy Considerations:**

- Ensure PDFs have selectable text for legibility to Turnitin. 
- Clarify communication and policies regarding Turnitin usage with students.
