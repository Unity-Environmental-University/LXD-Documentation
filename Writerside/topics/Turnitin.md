# Turnitin

> Files uploaded to Turnitin must be in Word Doc or PDF format only (no Apple Pages documents) 



Can use with Canvas Outcomes, Peer Review, Groups
*Same workflow for the students, with one minor change (a checkbox)
Matched similarity - give students the benefit of the doubt; Flags - intentional text manipulations

## Create an assignment
We’re going to attach turn it in to an assignment

Syllabus language (or elsewhere?) noting that assignments are being submitted/collected with Turn It In

Submission type: Online

Text entry, file upload, or both (no link for google doc)

**Does not integrate with Discussion boards - some institutions are dual submitting in discussion and assignments to allow for plagiarism check of DBs

Will get an ! if students submit a file type that cannot be plagiarism checked (eg, an image) → infographics probably not able to be used

Use as formative assessment - allow for multiple attempts to let them make revisions after an initial submission and report back

Plagiarism review - select turn it in

Exclusions: Bibliographic materials, quotes

> Suggestion: do not exclude quotes, we want Turn It In to match the quotes to the repository, helps instructor to see quotes

Index submissions - allows to add students’ work to repository for future indexing
Similarity report: run on immediate and due date - checks again if a student uses another’s material after a submission

Show sim report to students: Immediate, after grade, after due date, Never → immediate is best if formative

How does group assignment work - will it flag students even though they are supposed to collaborate? → might get flagged but don’t rely on the similarity score

*Will copy and BP over
*Wait 90 seconds between set up and submission

When certain things are locked in the BP, don’t think you can lock plagiarism framework - instructors could change it

Google Apps and Micosoft Office365 integration should convert to PDF, URL submission we will need to require 2 submissions - URL and some type of file
Students upload an assignment, must click an “I agree” check box”

Click over to “Grades” in order to view the originality report. Color indicator
Click the color indicator, which brings student out of canvas and into a file preview in a new window with the similarity report

Can exclude items - eg essay prompt,

Students can exclude items, but this does not affect what the instructor sees
Click “Share” - creates a PDF of the similarity report - student can use this to improve writing

Questionmark icon for details, help

Students will only see the Similarity report for the most recently submitted attempt; they won’t be able to access the Similarity reports for previous attempts

Instructor
Can go in via “Grades” or “Speedgrader”
Color scale 0 matches to 75% and up
As an instructor, can go into previous submission and see the other % (how to see changes in similarity report percents)
All feedback, commenting will be done with speedgrader, rubric will be attached
Click the color to see the PDF similarity report
Instructor sees the flags


Don’t want one match or source on the works cited page → indicates source list is a match from one student to another or an article
Templates, prompts will set off similarity
→ Text similarity vs. Plagiarism
There is no magic number (%) for similarity report – too varied based on similarity type, assignment format, etc. → don’t assume what a % means plagiarism-wise
Can click exclude and choose why to exclude the text
Can also click “all sources”  (in sources overview menu) to see lots of places where the text is appearing
Settings → Small Matches → Can adjust word count of similar words (eg <8, <11)
Give students benefit of the doubt for %
Flags are something to follow up on
Eg swapping e’s (Latin vs. cyrillic) to not be caught, putting white “” to hide the quoting, putting characters between strings of text, can increase word count with hidden text to lower similarity %
