# Course Edit and Feedback Form

Here's a link to the [Course Feedback Form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZxjqK-mEo3XEPnUmYUEvYDO9d1DaniUffVGZSeQ83Ps/edit?usp=sharing)
Instructors of the course (the SME who designed it or other instructors) give feedback on the course. Changes are identified as immediate need or for the next course run. If changes reach a more substantial threshold, the course will be refreshed or rebuilt. The LTSS team manages the Course Edit and Feedback Form. They may be able to enact the changes themselves, and if not, they will elevate the changes to the Director of Learning Experience Design, deans, etc.
