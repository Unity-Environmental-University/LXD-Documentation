# Finding an Instructor&apos;s Photo and Bio

There are three places you can find an instructor’s photo and bio: the Canvas Faculty Bios Page, the Canvas Instructor Orientation Assignment, and Google Drive.
In most cases, the automatic profile process can find and insert profile pictures in bios for you. However, if it cannot find them you may need to look elsewhere.

## Faculty Bios and Pics Pages
This is the first place to look for faculty bios and pics ([link here](https://unity.instructure.com/courses/3716914/pages)). 

This Canvas course houses pics/bios for nearly all instructors. This is the source where all automatic profile update processes draw pictures and bios. 

Sometimes an instructor may have a page here that does not exactly match their name in system and so the profile script has a hard time finding it. Each page has a section 
with the instructor's bio and a picture on it. 

## Instructor Orientation
If a Faculty Page does not exist for an instructor, you may be able to find it in the [Instructor Orientation](https://unity.instructure.com/courses/3778116). 

You can find instructors [Module 1 Assignment “Bio and Profile Photo” SpeedGrader section](https://unity.instructure.com/courses/3778116/gradebook/speed_grader?assignment_id=41211055). 

Find the Instructor in the top right bar (you can use Ctrl+F and instructor name to find them).

Once you have gotten the photo and bio, please make a new page in Faculty Bios and Pics for that instructor. 
* Create a new page by copying another faculty profile page.
* Replace the photo and bio with the one you found in the assignment.
* Replace the instructor name with the desired instructor's display name (this is where to add honorifics, use preferred names if different from canvas user names, etc)
* Make sure the photo size is < 500px wide, resizing as necessary. Many faculty submit photos directly from their phone or album where they are very large by default and can make for very slow load times on the homepage.
* Rename the page to the instructor's name exactly as it appear on their canvas account (i.e. how their name appears as the instructor of the course in the course search screen)
The automated profile process should now pick up this person's name.

After creating a new page, upload their photo and bio to google drive:
* Go to DE External → Marketing → Add Folder → Label the Folder by the Instructor’s Name.
* Upload the photo and copy the bio into a Google Doc with Instructor Name Bio as the title.

## Google
Some instructor photos and bios can be found on Google Drive. You can find these by:
* In Google by going to DE external → marketing → Faculty Bios, Pics and CVs
* Download the photo from GoogleDrive.
* Create a new page for them and upload to google drive per instructions above.

## No Photo / Bio Available
If the instructor has not yet uploaded their photo to the canvas assignment and is not in the drive folder, email them directly (or add this request to the Course Copy Notification email) to request their photo and bio. As a new hire, their @Unity email may not be activated, so use their Unity email and their personal address as well.
Create a Faculty Page for them and upload their info to google drive (see above) when you receive the new bio and pic.
