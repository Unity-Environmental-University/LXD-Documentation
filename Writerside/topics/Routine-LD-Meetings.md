# Routine LD Team Meetings

**Core Samplers Meeting (LD Team Meeting)**: All team members meet to go over questions, ideas, issues, new tech, suggestions, future planning, etc. Occurs every other week. Look for Google doc called LXD Agenda. 

**Development Meetings**: LXDs (and sometimes others from team) meet with Deans to update them on courses in development and other programmatic matters. Occurs every other week.

**One-on-one check-in**: Team members meet with the Assistant Director and Director for a personal check in and status update. 

**DE Team Meeting**: The LXDs, LTSSs, and XR specialist, concierges, advisors, directors, deans, and VP of DE meet for matters impacting the whole distance education division. Occurs periodically.

**Playground**: LD team meets to apply new technology applications, and other projects. Occurs about once a month. 

**New build kick-off meeting**: Initial meeting with a SME to lay out the course design process and begin brainstorming course project ideas. [Ideally], SMEs present their course project ideas without templates/models/exemplars so as to start off with a blank slate. As the process unfolds, exemplars and other supports can be introduced to guide the SME through the process. This will also be the time to set up the timeline and add the SME to Unity Dev courses for examples.

**Course build check-in meetings**: Meet to continue working on the course project and associated elements, brainstorm further, troubleshoot, revise. This may be best to set up as a recurring meeting. 

**Salon**: The LD Team meets to explore a question deeply, share diverse perspectives, and generate innovative ideas. The question of discussion is introduced by one member of the team who also provides an article on the subject. Beforehand, team members are expected to read or watch the shared material to prepare for discussion.
