## OCR - Optical Character Recognition
### What is OCR used for?
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) can be used to convert PDF images with text that is currently not screen readable 
(appearing as a picture) so the text can be recognized by a screen reader.

### When should LXDs use OCR on learning materials?
If a learning material that is a PDF file (scanned textbook pages, article, etc.) is in the form of a photo, meaning you
cannot highlight the text with your cursor, it is not screen readable and will need to be converted using OCR.

  - Adobe will now scan all pages and recognize the text the best that it can.
  - When the scan is complete, try to highlight the text with your cursor to confirm that it worked.
  - Click the save icon and the upper right-hand corner.
  - You can now upload the screen readable PDF file to Canvas


### Important Notes
* The more pages in a file, the longer the OCR will take, files over 20 pages will likely take more than a few minutes 
  to convert.
* Some scanned documents (particularly older textbooks scanned by SMEs) will not convert well. You can check to see if 
  all the words are highlighted by your cursor after you complete the OCR scan.
* Even if the OCR tool works, consider replacing files that are poorly copied and difficult to read
