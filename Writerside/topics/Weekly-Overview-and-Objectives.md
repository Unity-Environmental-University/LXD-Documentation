The **Overview** offers a roadmap for the week’s 
content and tasks and how they intersect. 
SMEs can make more direct references to their pedagogical 
choices in the overview and clarify the beginning and end 
points of the week’s lessons.

Each week has defined **Weekly Objectives** that orient the 
students to what they will learn and accomplish each week. 
The weekly objectives contribute to the overall course 
outcomes in smaller or more specific elements.
