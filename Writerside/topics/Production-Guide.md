# Production Guide

This production guide is designed to assist the Creative Media Developer team as well as SMEs and Deans in preparing for polished, scripted sit-down interviews. These interviews will be used to narrate course trailers, delivering the same caliber and engagement found in MasterClass trailers. The guide covers everything from script development and interview techniques to camera presence and post-production, ensuring a professional and captivating final product.

## Pre-Production
### Script Development & Review
   - **Outline Key Messages:** The Creative Media Developer (CMD) team will collaborate with Deans and/or SMEs to develop the script, ensuring authenticity by incorporating the SME's domain knowledge and preserving the tone and voice of Unity University. The CMD team will provide feedback during this process.
   - **Rehearsals:** SMEs/Deans will familiarize themselves with the script and practice their delivery on their own time.
### Visual and Stylistic Elements
   - **Wardrobe:** Solid colors, avoid busy patterns. Request SMEs/Deans have options ready for the shoot.
   - **Setting and Props:** Use a seamless backdrop. Alternatively, dress the set with visually appealing furniture and create depth with practical lighting.
   - **Props:** If applicable, incorporate props or tools that the SME may use or refer to while narrating, ensuring theyâ€™re accessible and add value to the course trailer.
   - **Pre-Light:** Schedule lighting test with a stand-in to ensure exposure and color balance are dialed in for the shoot day. Use three-point lighting to illuminate the SME, avoiding harsh shadows and creating a flattering appearance.

## Production
### Technical Setup
- **Lighting:** (see pre-light)
- **Audio:** Use boom mic and/or lavaliers to ensure clear and crisp audio. Monitor levels during shoot to avoid peaking.
- **Camera Angles:** Utilize A and B cameras to capture a wide and side/profile shot, offering the ability to intercut interviews and create dynamic visuals.
- **Teleprompter Use:** Setup teleprompter at eyeline/camera height and ensure the text is easy to read and practice its use with the SME/Dean beforehand.
- **On-Camera Performance:** SME/Dean will sit comfortably, maintain good posture, and make natural gestures.
- **Eye Contact:** SME/Dean will look just off-camera or directly at it if it feels natural.
- **Pace and Clarity:** SME/Dean will speak at a measured pace, enunciating clearly while maintaining a conversational tone.
- **Script Read Corrections:** Continuous takes will enable SMEs and Deans to seamlessly revisit specific sections of the script without interruption, ensuring multiple takes can be captured for the best possible result.
## Post-Production
### Review Footage
- **Pick selects:** Footage will be ingested into Premiere Pro and the best takes will be selected using markers and then cut into a SLX timeline.
### Edit
- **Assembly:** These narration takes will be stitched together in a multitrack timeline, allowing for seamless intercutting between wide and profile angles.
- **B-roll:** Supplementary footage will be used to visually enhance and illustrate the narration. This footage will be sourced from a mix of stock footage, screen recordings, and exemplary student work, all obtained with the necessary permissions and licensing.
- **Consistency:** Ensure that the final video maintains a high production value with consistent color grading, sound quality, and editing style similar to a MasterClass promotional video.
- **Supplementary Graphics:** Use text overlays like lower 3rds titles, graphics, and visual aids to enhance the key points discussed.
