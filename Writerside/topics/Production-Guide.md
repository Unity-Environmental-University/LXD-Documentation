# Scripted Interview Production Guide

This production guide is designed to assist the Creative Content team as well as Deans and SMEs in preparing for polished, scripted sit-down interviews. These interviews will be used to narrate course trailers, delivering the same caliber and engagement found in MasterClass trailers. The guide covers everything from script development and interview techniques to camera presence and post-production, ensuring a professional and captivating final product.

## Pre-Production
### Script Development & Review
   - **Outline Key Messages:** The Creative Media Developer (CMD) will collaborate with Deans and/or SMEs to develop the script, ensuring authenticity by incorporating the SME's domain knowledge and preserving the tone and voice of Unity Environmental University. The CMD team will provide feedback during this process.
   - **Rehearsals:** Deans/SMEs will familiarize themselves with the script and practice their delivery on their own time. During production, time will be allocated for practice takes. 
### Visual and Stylistic Elements
   - **Wardrobe:** Solid colors, avoid busy patterns. Request Deans/SMEs have options ready for the shoot.
   - **Setting and Props:** Use a solid seamless or muslin backdrop. Alternatively, dress the set with visually appealing furniture and create depth with practical lighting. If applicable, incorporate props or tools that the SME may use or refer to while narrating, ensuring they add value to the course trailer.
   - **Pre-Light:** Schedule lighting test with a stand-in subject to ensure exposure and color balance are dialed in "on the day". Use three-point lighting to illuminate the Dean/SME, avoiding harsh shadows and creating a flattering appearance.

## Production
### Technical Setup
- **Lighting:** (See pre-light). Scheduling will account for all staging of equipment.
- **Audio:** Secure a shotgun mic on a boom positioned 5" to 15" above subject to ensure clear and crisp audio. Monitor levels during shoot to avoid peaking.
- **Camera Angles:** Utilize A and B cameras to capture a wide and side/profile shot, offering the ability to intercut interview shots and create dynamic visuals.
- **Teleprompter Use:** Setup teleprompter at eye level/camera height and ensure the text scrolls at an appropriate pace and practice its use with the Dean/SME beforehand.
- **On-Camera Performance:** Dean/SME will sit comfortably, maintain good posture, and make natural gestures.
- **Eye Contact:** Dean/SME should look directly at the A camera, where the teleprompter will be positioned.
- **Pace and Clarity:** Dean/SME should speak with enthusiasm and clarity, using a tone that conveys excitement about the institution's mission and the course. The teleprompter speed can be adjusted to align with their optimal reading pace, with a setting of 10 serving as the standard pace.
- **Script Read Corrections:** Continuous takes will enable Dean/SME to seamlessly revisit specific sections of the script without interruption, ensuring multiple takes can be captured for the best possible result.
## Post-Production
### Review Footage
- **Pick selects:** Note the best takes and record the file names in a text file.
### Color Correct LOG Video
- **Color Grade:** Import the corresponding video files into DaVinci Resolve, apply a corrective Rec. 709 LUT, and color grade the LOG footage. Then export graded ProRes 422 HQ files for editing in Premiere Pro.

### Edit
- **Ingest**: graded footage into Premiere Pro, create proxies, and a Multicam Sequence from the graded source footage. 
- **Assembly:** In a new SLX timeline, remove pauses and edit the best narration takes, allowing for seamless intercutting between wide and profile angles.
- **B-Roll:** Supplementary footage will be used to visually enhance and illustrate the narration. This footage will be sourced from a mix of stock, screen recordings, and exemplary student work, all obtained with the necessary permissions and licensing.
- **Graphics:** Use lower 3rds titles to identify the narrator and add any necessary graphic visual aids to enhance the key points discussed.
- **Sound Sweetening:** Apply a `Dialogue` preset to all narration audio from the`Essential Sound` pane and adjust preset strength, EQ, and clip volume accordingly.
- **Sound Design:** Add sound effects (SFX) where appropriate, sourcing from stock websites.
- **Captions:** Add captions to the timeline by selecting `Create Captions` from the `Transcript` pane in Premiere Pro.
- **Consistency:** Ensure that the final video maintains a high production value with consistent color grading, sound quality, and editing style similar to a MasterClass promotional video.
- **Export:** video as H.264 with `Match Source` preset and `Create Sidecar File` selected in the Captions dropdown. Video settings: 1920x1080 (1.0) progressive with VBR 1 pass bitrate encoding and 15Mbps target bitrate. 
- **Upload:** to Kaltura and share link for review.
