# Entering Course as a Student or Instructor

Student preview mode should ***almost always be used***, but in very specific cases you may need to enter Canvas as an individual student or instructor.

> ***Student Preview Mode:*** Click the “student view” button at the top of the Canvas page you’re working on to see it this way; in some cases, you will need to “complete” the academic integrity agreement in order to view the page as a student.
## Entering as a Student or Instructor
You must be careful to not post, submit, make any correspondence, etc while in the course. Remember, you are not “the student” or “the instructor” and are acting as them.
1. Go to Distance Education (Live). 
2. Click “People” in the left menu. 
3. Search for the student’s name or ID number or the instructor’s. 
4. Once the student pops up do not click on their name, instead click the mask icon on the right hand side. 
5. View the issue. 
6. Exit by clicking the “leave student view” in the bottom right corner. 
7. Close the window.
