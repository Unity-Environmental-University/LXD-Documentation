# Google Drive

## For personal or Unity accounts

In addition to Canvas, we will be utilizing Google Drive to upload and share image files for assignments.  You have access to Google Drive via your Unity.edu account.
Google Drive is a great tool to familiarize yourself with as it makes it easy to create and share media. It is often used in other courses, as well as in professional settings. This [class/assignment/discussion) requires you to create Google Drive folders of your work and share the hyperlinks to those folders in the assignments’ discussion forums, allowing your classmates and your instructor to view your work.

In order to make sure you are comfortable using Google Drive and submitting your work to the assignments in this class, you will complete the following assignment to practice uploading work, creating a folder, and sharing a folder through Drive.

## For Unity Accounts Only

To complete this [assignment/discussion], you will need to work within Google Drive using your Unity College account. 

To do this, open [Google Drive](https://accounts.google.com/AccountChooser/signinchooser?service=writely&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=AccountChooser) in your internet’s browser.

Log in to Google Drive with your @unity.edu account information. Every time you work within your document, you will need to be logged in to your @unity.edu account. Additionally, to review a peer’s document, you will need to be logged in to your @unity.edu Google account.

Make sure your share settings are set to “Unity College: Anyone in this group with this link can view”.

If you experience trouble accessing a classmate’s document check the following:
1. Are you logged in to your @unity.edu Google account? To ensure you’re using your Unity College login information instead of a personal Google account, click the round icon in the top right corner in Google and select your Unity account if multiple accounts appear in the drop-down menu.  
2. Is the document’s share settings set to “Unity College: Anyone in this group with this link can view”?
