# Syncing a Change/Update to a Live Course from the Blueprint
If you are notified of a change that needs to be made in a Live course, you will make the change in its associated Blueprint (BP). **Never make a change (besides the syllabus/homepage) in a Live course.**

Complete the following steps to make a change in a Live course:
- Open the Blueprint from the DE account in Canvas.
- Find the edit that needs to be made in the Blueprint.
- Make the change(s) in the BP.
- Click the blue tab on the right hand side of the page (the Blueprint icon) to see what changes were made (should display a count of the number of changes since the previous sync). Depending on the hierarchy of the modules/assignments/etc. you may see more changes listed than were actually made. (Eg, a change on an individual assignment page will signal to Canvas that the assignment overview page also needs to change)
- Click “Sync” to push out the changes to the live courses.
  - The “Course settings” checkbox is never used. It would carry over meta-settings in the BP that we don't want pushed into the associated sections such as term settings. These are typically set in the live sections by the SIS.

Normally, instructors do not need to send an announcement for changes as they are typically small and unnoticeable to students. However, if information needs to be communicated to students - broken links, changed due dates, submission issues - the instructor should send an announcement to the class. Please ask them to do so when needed. Once a course is live, changes should not be made to the syllabus unless otherwise noted by a Dean or the Director of Instructional Design.

After making the change in the BP, you should make the changes in the DEV of the course as well so that it is fixed for future runs of the course.
