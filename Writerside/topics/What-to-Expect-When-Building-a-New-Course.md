# SME What to Expect When Building a New Course

Duties and Responsibilities of the SME

First, thank you for being the Subject Matter Expert (SME) for this course. Your
expertise is invaluable, and we are excited to work with you. This document will give
you some specifics on the process and expectations of a new course development.
There is a more in-depth [SME Documentation Guide](https://unityextendedreality.com/documentation/sme/sme-documentation.html) that you can consult after reading this
overview. **Your role as the SME is to help develop the course by creating and
shaping the content.** The role of the LXD is to function as the project manager, to
collaborate with you to plan, refine, and edit the content you create. The role of the dean
is to review, provide feedback, and approve the Course Project and Course Outline, and
ultimately, the course as a whole.

**Note:** You may, or may not, be one of the instructors teaching the course when it runs.

Once your contract with Unity has been signed, you will receive an email (with this
document) from the Assistant Director or Director of Distance Education Learning
Experience Design. This email will include the Learning Experience Designer (LXD)
assigned to work with you. It will also have some information about the course and the
role of the LXD. You will note the email contains the **Course Description, Course
Outcomes, Program Outcomes for Conceptual Development and Program
Outcomes to be Directly Assessed** (these last will need to be aligned at some point in
the course by an assignment). Additionally, the Assistant/Director sets the deadline for
completion.

1. **Please read** the Course Description, Course Outcomes, and Program Outcomes
   for Conceptual Development, as this will give you an idea of what students will be
   expected to be able to do upon completing the course.
2. The LXD will contact you to set up the first meeting via TEAMS videochat.
3. **First meeting:** this is a “get to know you” video conference, but it will also be the
   time to set the calendar for the next 12-16 weeks and follow up on this overview.
   SMEs and LXDs meet at least once a week, but this can be arranged between
   the two of you. As well, it is a perfect opportunity to ask the LXD questions.
4. **Adding you to a Development Course.** The LXD may add you to a course to
   see what example assignments, discussions, quizzes, instructions, overviews,
   Course Project, etc. look like. It is also a time to get to know what a 5 week, 1 to
   3 credit, undergraduate course and an 8 week, 3 credit graduate course looks
   like.
5. **Backward Design:** Good course development starts with understanding the
   Course Outcomes, which list what we want the students to be able to do when
   they leave the course. So, when building the course, the process at Unity always
   starts from where we want students to end up and move backwards. As you
   move from the big picture to the details, think about how the assignments help
   students achieve those outcomes.
6. **Course Project:** Unity Environmental University Distance Education works hard
   to provide hands-on, real-world opportunities to assess students. Each course
   has a well developed Course Project, the final deliverable of which is due at the
   end of the term. Earlier Course Project deliverables are collected in weekly
   assignments, a process called “scaffolding,” in a way designed to promote
   student success. Your LXD will help you with this.

   6. a. Usually in the first meeting, you and the LXD brainstorm on a Course
      Project as described above.
   6. b. The SME will be expected to provide examples of authentic artifacts,
      products, or processes from their discipline that form the basis of the
      Course Project.
7. **SME Homework:** You will be **creating, writing, and developing assignments**
   that align to the Course Project, sometimes directly, and sometimes the
   assignments will indirectly align. Each week you and the LXD will decide what
   needs to be prepared for the following meeting. Expect to have weekly
   homework outside of development meetings.
8. **Time Commitment:** Please spend time looking at sample assignments in the
   Development Course or documents that have been shared with you. Notice, in
   particular, the depth and specificity of assignment directions. This will help you
   map out your time commitment.
   Depending on the amount of homework you both decided on, you will need to
   map out how much time is needed to complete each assignment so they are
   ready at least one day prior to your scheduled meeting.
9. **Assignments:** In Canvas, all student activities that are assessed, fall under the
   category of Assignments; however, there are 3 separate Assignments that nest
   beneath this category: Assignments, Discussions, and Quizzes. 
   9. a. **Assignments:** You will design and write the description and steps
      students follow for each assignment. Unlike in face-to-face courses,
      students will only have these pages to go by, so assignment directions
      must be thorough and complete without requiring further context or
      explanation. These explicit instructions will help determine what is
      necessary for the rubric.
   9. b. **Discussions:** At least one discussion is required each week. These will
      also need written descriptions and instructions. Discussions require an
      initial post and at least 2 responses to other students’ posts.
   9. c. **Quizzes:** Quizzes are generally low stakes, and can be created using a
      variety of formats, including Multiple Choice, Short Answer, True/False,
      Essay Questions etc. These are not required, but if you create a quiz, you
      will also be expected to include the answers.
   9. d. **Labs:** Some courses require students to complete lab activities (hands-on
      or virtual) to gain experience with certain techniques or practices. You may
      review the catalog of simulations offered by [Labster](https://www.labster.com/simulations) (a 3rd party software)
      or another platform.
   9. e. **Use of AI:** Unity students are allowed to use AI to complete their
          assignments, discussions, etc. When designing the above assessments,
          specific guidance on how AI will be used must be incorporated.
10. **Video Recordings:** You will be required to record yourself on camera discussing
    an overview of the week’s material and/or specific content
11. **Feedback:** Course development is an iterative process, and substantial changes
    may be suggested throughout the review process by the Dean or LXD. So as the
    course development takes place, the course might go through a few more
    iterations before it is finalized. This could include re-writes of assignments,
    discussions, overviews, etc. Ultimately, the Dean has the final say on the
    course’s development and design.
