# Course Project Overview

Generally, Course Projects are introduced with their own Canvas landing page as opposed to existing only as an Assignment/Discussion. This page should be titled Course Project Overview and serve as a landing page for students to toggle between project elements; students can refer to a Course Project Overview and/or project components throughout the course as opposed to only viewing project portions in isolation. The DEV_template has the Course Project Overview as a Page in Week 1. The page should typically include an overview paragraph, course project overview video recorded by the SME, hyperlinked list of the project elements, and submission requirements. Often there are also sections about the project scenario and audience, if applicable. Similarly, in the assignments/discussions that reference the Course Project, create a link back to the overview page so students can navigate easily back and forth. 

The image below shows the primary elements of the Course Project Overview Template.
