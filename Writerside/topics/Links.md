# Links

Links are used to bring students outside of Canvas to an external page.
* Visit the page you would like to link to and copy the url.
* In Canvas, go to the Page you would like to edit.
* Click “Edit” and highlight the text you would like to link from.
* Click “Insert” then “link” then “external links” in the menu bar and paste the url in the box.
* If it is a video, “insert class=inline disabled” in the HTML so that the YouTube video preview isn’t on the page.
Click “Save”.
* The linked text should now appear in green. If you right-click on the text you can open the webpage in a new tab.
Some formatting issues may arise when copy/pasting bulleted lists over from Google Docs to canvas, so be on the lookout for indentation or non-standardized bullets that need to be reformatted. Occasionally there is an issue copy/pasting a list of links from google doc to canvas, to address this, delete the bulleted list and try to paste again without that canvas formatting and it should work.
