# Elements of a Course
One of the strengths of Unity courses is their regularity. Students can jump into any course, in
any program, and not be lost. They may not have what they need to succeed in the course, but
the course itself, as something to be navigated, should never be an impediment.

We achieve that regularity by being pretty conservative about UI variance between courses. The
mantra is something like: Students should be _doing_ different things, not _seeing_ different
things.

The pages in this section of LXD Documentation go into the regular structures students will
encounter in all of our courses.
