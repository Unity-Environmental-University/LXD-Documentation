# Grading in Canvas

## Rubrics
Rubrics should be specific to each assignment. We currently use holistic rubrics, though we are researching the
possibility of shifting to analytic rubrics (timestamp: Spring 2023).

### Rubric Guidance
* Criteria should not total more than 10 points in value
* Unless the criterion specifically targets aspects of the assignment that can be assessed as either "completed" or not,
all criterion must value more than 2 points.
* The total value of any assignment/discussion should stick to whole numbers divisible by 10 or 25, such as
  * 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 75, etc.
* Each criterion should be adequately described to promote fair grading practices

Typically rubric settings are the following:
* Create a rubric from scratch with the title matching the title of the assignment/discussion.
  * Click "+Rubric" at the bottom of the assignment or the "..." for Discussions to access the rubric.
  * ex: Rubric title should read as "Week 1 Assignment 2: [Assignment title]".
  * You can import previous rubrics from other assignments instead of creating them from scratch each time but be aware
  that you may see a (1) next to the title. Click "magnifying glass" to look for another rubric, then click "use for this
  assignment" and then edit as necessary.
* Check the boxes "Freeform comments" and "Use this rubric for assignment grading".
* You can duplicate or add criteria to the bottom of rubrics (but they **cannot** be reordered or reformatted) to expand
on previous rubrics.
  * The text for rubric criteria cannot easily have line breaks when formatting, so it is best to not try to use lists
  when writing rubric text.
* In some cases, the ID can change the point totals to standardize rubrics (e.g., in ENCJ, rubrics that only added up to
80 was changed to add up to 100).

## Schemes
Grading schemes are specific to graduate and undergraduate levels and measure scores against a specific criteria. This
is part of the Update checklist on the Trello card.

<procedure title="To enable a grading scheme:" id="enable-grading-scheme">
    <step>
        Go to the course settings.
    </step>
    <step>
        Check the box "Enable Course Grading Scheme".
    </step>
    <step>
        Select the appropriate grading scheme: courses of 500 and up = grad; 400 and less = undergrad.

'DE Undergraduate Programs', a button saying 'View/Edit', and a clickable link that reads 'Manage All Grading Schemes'."/>

</procedure>

## Course Grading Category Percentages
On the Syllabus page, a table on the right side of the page displays the grade breakdown for the course (e.g. Assignments
30%, Discussion 40%, Course Project 30%). This is **not** editable on the syllabus page, but is found on the Assignments
page. Click "Assignments" in the left column then "edit" and the overall course percentages will be editable on this page,
then autofill into the Syllabus page.
