# Refresh and Redesign Process

As a reminder, a **New Build** involves creating a course 
that has never been offered. This includes a visioning of the 
course, creation of outcomes and description aligned with the 
program outcomes and description, selection of materials, creation 
of content, creation of assessments and rubrics aligned with the 
outcomes, full design and delivery of the course, etc.

A course **Refresh** involves making changes to “major” curricular 
elements of the course content or delivery. This includes: Entirely 
new key assessment; New course concept or focus (may be in response 
to changes in the field, such as a key resource like the Psychology 
manual DSM IV being replaced by DSM-V); Re-alignment of course to 
new programmatic learning outcomes; changes made to a “substantial” 
portion of the course; removal or change of a textbook. A refresh is 
typically on a shorter timeline because of the smaller scope of the 
changes made to the course.

For a course **Rebuild**, depending on the scope of the changes, the 
process may involve keeping some elements of the existing course or 
an entire rebuild, where the course is designed from a blank slate. 

A redesign undergoes the same process as a new build, though some pre-existing course components may be incorporated into the redesigned course.

Deliverables are articulated during the Kick-Off Meeting. Roles and deadlines are assigned to the IAPs as appropriate. 

**IAPs**: Dean, Learning Experience Designer, a Subject Matter Expert, Learning Technology Support Specialist.

## Refresh Timeline

The refresh timeline follows an adapted new course build timeline because some elements of the pre-existing course can be used. However, it is important to determine the scope and nature of the refresh. Each refresh varies greatly depending on what course elements need to be changed. Initial meetings for a refresh typically involve processing course feedback from SMEs/Instructors, Deans, Students, or LXDs. This feedback will orient the SME and LXD to the necessary changes, and the Director of Learning Experience Design will attend this meeting to ensure the scope of the rebuild is clear to the SME. There should be a clear rationale for why the refresh is needed. Repurposing old material can (eventually) take longer than simply creating a new assignment or discussion, so planning at this stage is critical. A change to the Course Project may impact most areas of the course, whereas individual assignment or discussion changes are typically more self-contained. After the initial planning meetings, the refresh mirrors a new build where the SME and LXD develop the new course content, while the SME also evaluates the current course material. When the refresh outline is complete, a Dean will often want to sign off on the changes, as they would during a new build. The level of formality of the review corresponds to the scope and type of changes made to the course. Once approved, the changes can be implemented on the course in Canvas.
