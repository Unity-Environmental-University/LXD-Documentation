# Updating Due Dates

Due dates are typically 3 AM ET Thursday and 3 AM ET Monday but appear in Canvas as 3 AM ET Monday. Since an assignment/discussion can only have one assigned due date in its settings, the Thursday date must be clearly written within the instructions of the assignment/discussion. For example, a Week 1 Discussion 1 initial post is due by 3 AM ET Thursday and the response posts are due by 3 AM ET Monday, however, the discussion would show a 3 AM ET Monday final due date.

Assignment due times are set in the course for ET to create a standardized time by which assignments are due and to prevent some students from having more time to complete assignments than others based on their time zone. Within Canvas settings, students actually have the option to change their time zone, which could enable them to gain more time for an assignment by altering the time. Canvas will auto-adjust the due time for students based on ET to their timezone, eg a 9pm deadline on the west coast for students. This policy is outlined in the syllabus text regarding late work. The assignment will be marked late in Canvas but can be adjusted by the instructor.

_Note:_ While updating a course if you notice an assignment is due on an alternate date (not a Thursday or Monday), find the corresponding date in the new term. For example, a paper is due on Friday in the course you are updating. The paper should be due on a corresponding Friday in the new term. Check the Course Oddities document (in the Update checklist) for possible information about non Monday due dates.

<h2>Specific Due Dates</h2>

- The opening of the Course Overview Module sets the gatekeeping rules (adaptive release). Students will not be allowed to access other course components until they have “signed” the Academic Integrity Agreement and this will not open until Monday at midnight for the start of term, so students are “locked out” from course content until the term actually starts.
- Introductions: due the first Thursday by 3 AM ET of the course and are used for students to post attendance (withdrawal date is Wednesday of the first week).
   - Introductions should be included in the Week 1 Modules.
   - The due date for Introductions is important because it supports Dropout Detective. They should be 0 points and set to complete/incomplete.
- By default, assignments and discussions are due 3 AM ET.

<h2>Lock Until Dates</h2>
Modules 1 through 5 or 8 should be unlocked on the first day of the term with a “Prerequisite Course Introduction” setting. This can be found by clicking the “...” of the module on the Modules page.
