# Course Edit and Feedback from an Instructor

After you copy a course to the live section, you should send a Section Ready email to the instructor(s) ([template here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EnO5nX2CvNVkpvtp2yMEeEchIK0mFt75HdjuzJhdbiw/edit#heading=h.r896ujn1yn19)). This email should include a link to the “[Course Edit and Feedback Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeybl9b-xk-pL1bsWX7x9esQYoHHyi3rPPOq75mK4Q4n4b5tQ/viewform)”. If there are changes that need to be made to the course, instructors will fill out the form. Change requests are assigned automatically to Learning Technology Support specialists who address and/or escalate them as appropriate. 

Based on the feedback on the course, changes are identified as immediate need or for the next course run. If changes reach a more substantial threshold, the course will be refreshed. 

There should also be a link to the feedback form in the instructor module of each section.
