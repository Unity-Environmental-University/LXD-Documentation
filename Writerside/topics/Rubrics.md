# Rubrics

<!--Writerside adds this topic when you create a new documentation project.
You can use it as a sandbox to play with Writerside features, and remove it from the TOC when you don't need it anymore.-->

Every graded element should have an associated rubric, with the following exceptions:
- Automatically graded quiz questions. 
- Anything with an answer key replacing either automatic grading functionality or a rubric <warning>Discuss answer keys with your supervisor; they're generally a bad idea. Answer key is, here, referring to any document or resource that guides instructor grading that is not in a rubric format.</warning>

Rubrics should always have "Use this rubric for assignment grading" checked.

Right now, unless otherwise noted, rubrics are "holistic" in style, meaning they have "I will write freeform comments" checked. 

## Undergrad

To-be-drafted

## Grad

Grad rubrics should distribute points for citation among all relevant criteria. Meaning: Don't create an isolated criterion for citations,
instead add citation requirements to all criteria where citation may be important.
