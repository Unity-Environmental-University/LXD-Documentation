# LXD Team Goals

Unity Distance Education provides quality, experiential STEM education in an 
asynchronous online format to historically underserved populations. We do this by:
- Keeping tuition prices down 
- Being transparent about all costs, and trying to keep materials for courses free or affordable
- Developing courses within strict formatting / UI parameters so that students don't have to navigate wildly different looking/functioning courses to **do** compellingly differentiated, experiential assignments
