# Studio

#### Accessing Studio
You can access your personal Canvas Studio library by clicking the Studio icon in the green navbar. You can access a course’s Studio library from within the course by clicking on “Studio” in the course-level navigation sidebar.

If you’re using Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge, you can record your [webcam](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Studio-Guide/How-do-I-record-a-webcam-video-in-Canvas-Studio-using-a-Chrome/ta-p/594582) or [screen capture](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Studio-Guide/How-do-I-record-a-screen-capture-video-in-Canvas-Studio-with-a/ta-p/587931) in the browser.

If you’re using Firefox or Safari, you can still record your [webcam](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Studio-Guide/How-do-I-record-a-webcam-video-in-Canvas-Studio-with-a-Safari-or/ta-p/1687) in the browser, but to record [screen captures](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Studio-Guide/How-do-I-record-a-screen-capture-video-in-Canvas-Studio-with-a/ta-p/1706), you will need to download the screen capture software.

Studio can also be found in the Rich Text Editor (RTE).

#### Submitting with Studio

To Create a “Studio Assignment Submission” option, you can do either of the following (with the first option preferred):
1. Select “Online Submission” in the dropdown and then enable “File Uploads.” “Studio” will automatically appear as a tabbed option for the student to record/choose-recorded studio content for submission.
2. Select “Online Submission” in the dropdown and then enable “Text entry.” Students will be able to select Studio as an option via the RTF’s “Plugins” button.

Students can submit using Studio when, in an assignment “File Upload” is selected. Studio will appear as a tab option when students go to submit their assignment.

In a discussion, students use the same plugin method in the RTE to access Canvas studio and submit their videos.
