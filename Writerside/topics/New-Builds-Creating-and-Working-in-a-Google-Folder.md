# New Builds - Creating and Working in a Google Folder

>This page focuses on creating and managing a Google folder throughout the New Build process. For more information on the New Build process and timeline, see [this page.](Course-Development-Timeline-and-Workflow.md)

### Creating a Folder in Google

Before replying to the Head or Assistant Head of Learning Experience Design’s “Kick Off Email” to a new SME, you should create a Course Development folder in Google. This folder will contain all of the documents/resources needed for the course. 
- Create a course folder with the course code in the [Course Builds folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1W0oNKAlFCY2g2mRV82DNidvTzeNKtw37?usp=drive_link). 
  - Within this folder create the New Build Folder with the course code and term the new course is launching.
  - Example: MARI 505 (main folder), MARI 505 Winter 2020 New Build (subfolder).
- Be sure that the permission is set to “Restricted” and add the instructor’s Unity email to the list of “Share with People and Groups”. A Unity email also serves as a Gmail/Drive account.
  - Generally, SMEs should use their Unity-provided email address for course edits.  This helps prevent multiple documents and limits work to the shared space that is also visible to the deans. In the event of a SME leaving or discontinuing work, it also ensures we still have access to the necessary materials in Drive. However, if a SME is set on using their personal gmail or lacks the tech skills to work effectively, you may add their personal gmail to the folder. Prioritize the work getting done well and in a timely manner over tech troubleshooting and use your best judgment. Google has a variety of tutorials you can recommend to the SME, if needed; working in Google Docs promotes an easy to monitor workflow.
- Copy the following resources from the [Course Development Resources folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-1ofnCYNCW4H1D3u68CT1uP3qMPMKJWQ?usp=drive_link) and move the copies into the new build folder:
  - Course Project Pre-Approval Template 
  - NEW DESIGN Course Project Template 
  - NEW DESIGN Course Outline Template 
  - Course Development Timeline Template 
  - Instructor Guide Template 
  - QA Checklist Template
- Rename the above 6 files to reflect the course code.
- This [mock timeline spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rriKwipOATP_YnFQYscFvwZQ-ZWHCHUeifdPAo3rSds/edit?usp=sharing) can help set up tentative development dates that can be input into the course development timeline.
- Within the Course Development Resources folder, there are other helpful documents such as sample course projects and a Bloom's taxonomy planning kit. Consider creating a shortcut to these documents within your newly created course folder.
- Send the Kick Off Email reply to the SME with a link to the new folder and important documents. See this [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EnO5nX2CvNVkpvtp2yMEeEchIK0mFt75HdjuzJhdbiw/edit?usp=sharing) for guidance on drafting your email. 

### Working Within the Folder
Work begins in the Course Project Pre-Approval document to isolate it from the rest of the course outline and development process. An idea for the project is drafted and sent to the Dean for approval. Once the project idea is approved, work begins in the Course Project document. This is where the student facing instructions for all course project related assignments and discussions are drafted, as well as rubrics and supplementary materials. When the course project is approved, work can shift into the Course Outline document. However, when importing course project elements to the course outline, link to the course project document and do not copy/paste instructions into the course outline because then the instructions live in two places and need upkeep in both. 

To link to a course project section in a Google doc from another Google doc:
- Highlight a line/title in the course project doc and create a bookmark (under Insert) then copy the associated link.
- In the outline doc, highlight the text you’d like to turn into a link.
- Click the hyperlink button and paste the bookmark link from the course project document.

### Dealing with and resolving Comments:
As work progresses on course project documents and course outlines, there are often many suggestions and comments made by SMEs, LXDs, and Deans. In order to best track changes and the resolution of suggestions/comments, please following these guidelines:

- Instruct SMEs to turn on comment notifications within the Google document. In the document, go to Tools - Notification Settings - All Comments. This will allow the SME, who is generally not the owner of the doc, to receive notifications when the Dean and LXD make new comments and suggestions. 
- Instruct SMES to leave Deans’ comments. Dean and Associate Dean comments are to be resolved ONLY by LXDs or Deans themselves.
*The LXD is responsible for communicating this information to SMEs. 

We typically expect SMEs to have some experience working in Google Drive and with tasks such as sharing folders, copying docs, and collaborative writing. However, you may need to instruct them on certain tasks, such as checking the user/account if they have multiple accounts or uploading documents.
