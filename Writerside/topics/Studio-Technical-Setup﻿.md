# Studio Technical Setup Guide

## Lighting
Use three-point lighting to illuminate the SME/Dean, avoiding harsh shadows and creating a flattering appearance.
- Place key light on subject’s smart side (away from the camera) and fill light on the subject’s dumb side (facing the camera) for maximized depth.
- Adjust barn doors to direct light and avoid excessive blooming from rim light.

## Audio
- Place Sennheiser shotgun mic just out of frame above the subject via boom stand on the subject’s dumb side.
- Plug male end of XLR into the XLR to 3.5mm jack adapter. Then plug 3.5mm jack into Sony FX3 audio input.
- Audio Rec Level should be set to 18.
- Test and monitor levels, which should range from -18db to -6db for crisp audio.
