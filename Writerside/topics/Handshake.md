How to search for internships

1. Select “jobs” in the upper left corner.  
2.  Select the “internship” filter on the search bar
3. Enter descriptor for field of desired internship

   a. Use specific terms such as “habitat restoration” to narrow your results
   
    b. Use general terms such as “environmental” for broader results
   
    c. You can also search for the name of specific companies/employers
4.  Select a job from the results on the left hand side of the screen
5. You can scroll down to see peers who have worked/are working the job and message them and in some cases, the hiring manager will have their contact information posted
6. Scroll down further in order to see a description of the company
7. Scroll down to the bottom in order to find the link to a full profile of the company

By looking at the full profile of the company, you will find information that you can include in your letter, to show that you have done at least some basic research on the company.  Remember, this could be your first impression to the company/hiring manager, so make it count by utilizing the information that is available to you.  Messaging peers could also help you get more background information on the company, if desired.
