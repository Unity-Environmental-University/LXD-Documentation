# Wiki Page - MBAQ 203
[The World Atlas of Aquaculture](http://worldaquacultureatlas.pbworks.com/w/page/140013960/Home%20Page)

This course project allows students to create their own page that will be available to students in their current and 
future terms.

We use one shared account [learningexperiencedesign@unity.edu](mailto:learningexperiencedesign@unity.edu)) to manage this tool. To log into that account, you'll need
to use the login credentials and password for the WorldAtlasWiki at the top of the [Institutional Passwords Google](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xUje6ce-csNt6mWpTTRekkMaC-ibUcLe5deWI67tVVs/edit?tab=t.0) doc.

        When you send the Course Copied Notification email to instructors, provide the instructions: “Students in this 
        class create a Wiki page for their course project. You have been added as an Administrator to the Wiki site for 
        the Atlas. You should have an email in your Unity email account inviting you to join the workspace. Please open 
        this email and click "Join the workspace." Once you click that link and create your account, you will be able to
        approve your students requests to join the wiki. In order for students to create a Wiki page for their course 
        project, they need to request access to the site by clicking a link on the Course Project page in Canvas. This 
        will email you to your unity account (check your spam folder). Please add students as requests come into
        your email inbox and grant them “writer” access. Please do not make any changes to the Users tab or delete 
        users/content from previous terms.”
