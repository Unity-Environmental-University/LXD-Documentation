# Other Course Pages

Some courses may require you to create a new page for added resources or other course elements.
## Examples
- If courses have references that will be used throughout the course, rather than during a specific weekâ€™s learning materials, a new page may be the best place for this information. 
- Websites with data sets used in the course may merit their own pages. Research and citation guides are also becoming more common in courses as a new page type.
