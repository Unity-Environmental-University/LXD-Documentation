# Course Images
**Banner and other images**

Images are used on nearly every page and assignment of the course. When adding images, please think about the following:

-  Is the image aligned with the topic/content on the page? If you are uncertain, put a generic image. For example, if the assignment discusses a certain breed of horse, and you are unsure, add an image of horses in the distance.
-  When adding images for assignments and discussions, try to use an image that will help students set a purpose before they read. For example, if there is an assignment that discusses return on investment, you might find an image that shows ROI in Scrabble letters, or building blocks.
-  When adding images for Learning Materials, Homepage, Overview etc. try to find photos that align to the idea(s) on that page. For example, if Week 2 Learning Materials focuses on marine mammals, please make sure the photo is a marine mammal.
-  Be aware of diversity in your photos. Are most of your images showing people of similar age, gender, ethnic background etc.? As well, is your photo perpetuating a stereotype?
-  Unity has specific guidelines to follow when adding animal photos. Please look at these [guidelines](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zfDZAUHZsHRAzsL2lEcbiWEoJ8JMLrTJ1GXBhEiAb6g/edit#slide=id.g277b6ef7b1d_0_1291) to help.

**To add an image to an assignment, discussion, or module page:**
1. There are several options for adding photos. There is a Google Folder called Course [Photos by Subject](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1W3Vu0Gv2c8LfjlW6Kppp1Rlwu2BH_6cq). The majority of these have been resized to fit into the banners.  Some other options are Unsplash or Envato to search for images. Unity has an account with Envato. Here is the login and password. The latter two do not need attribution. You may need to describe the image for screen readers in the “Alt text” field. However, the vast majority of images are decorative, and thus do not need alt text. When editing a photo, click the “This is for Decorative Purposes” box so that screen readers won’t read the alt text and simply skip over the image. This option will also pop up when you are uploading the photo. Make sure to scroll down a bit to find the Alt Text field and decorative purposes box.

**Instructor Photos (Homepage)**

Instructor photos are usually added through a script (created by Hallie for speedy processes).

1. However, if you have to manually add them, you can use the HTML and/or image file from the [Faculty Bios and Pics](https://unity.instructure.com/courses/3716914/pages) in Pages found in the link. Ask for help on how to do this.
2. If the Canvas page in the step above does not have the photo you need, please check the Instructor [Orientation in Speed Grader](https://unity.instructure.com/courses/3778116/gradebook/speed_grader?assignment_id=41211055&student_id=12956050) for the instructor. You will have to edit the homepage in the live section manually. You may also need to change to HTML and take the HTML from there and manually paste it into the live section. Again, ask for help.
3. If neither of those listed above have the instructor’s photos, please email the instructor. Use [this template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EnO5nX2CvNVkpvtp2yMEeEchIK0mFt75HdjuzJhdbiw/edit#bookmark=id.7gxeynavt35f) email that can be used to ask for a Bio and Pic. This [example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rqonkqWY8dR4MpZheqHKIQYy7QUWPYRl/edit) is what instructors should follow.
