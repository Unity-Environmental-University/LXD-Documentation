# Equity and Inclusivity Considerations for LXD Designing Courses

When designing courses, we undergo an “Equity check” process to review expectations, assumptions, and further opportunities. This pause and check moment/process can spur greater creativity and/or clarify instructions and outcomes. The following questions can help reframe course elements in order to ensure equitable experiences.

## What background and experiences am I / are we bringing to the course?

Often we bring our personal experiences and backgrounds to what we do, study, and create. Unfortunately, we don’t know what we don’t know! Even with the best intentions, this can produce (or reproduce) certain biases or assumptions. By consciously identifying our own identity and position, we can better understand where we may have a blindspot and work to address the potential issue or disparity.

## Are we leaving anyone out in our design?

In tandem with the previous question, considering other perspectives can also lead us to improve or shift our design. Incorporating other identities or perspectives can ultimately enrich the course or activity by seeing things in a new way.

## What do we notice about the course? Why do we notice what we notice?
This line of questioning pushes us to once again consider and reflect on our role in building this course. “Energy flows to attention” so by first identifying where our energy and attention are, we can then consider what pieces we may be neglecting. This heightened intentionality can support us in making more informed decisions about each area of the course.

## Is there a “shadow curriculum” or “hidden requirements” needed to complete tasks in this course?
When drafting a field work assignment, for example, do we assume that students have access to a car? that they can walk? Does a discussion about “state level farming policies presume a US-based location and/or prior knowledge of organic food designations?

[Possible Thinking Routines from Project Zero](https://pz.harvard.edu/thinking-routines) These thinking routines can prompt and help us consider equity parameters. By asking ourselves other lines of questions, we can uncover alternative design paradigms that will be more inclusive for students and enhance their learning.

What inequalities are we reproducing in how we design courses?
