# References Page

<note>This is a new process, as of 7/19/24, and it applies to all new builds
and rebuilds going forward. Existing courses that are being updated / refreshed
need not have the references page created for them. </note>

To avoid the unreadability that comes with APA style used throughout a course, 
every course needs to have a reference page, **linked from the [](Course-Overview-Page.md)**, 
that organizes all the references from the course in the following hierarchy:
- By week
  - Alphabetically

Finally, there is a space at the top of every references page where use of AI
in the authoring of course elements should be organized. Given the many ways in
which AI can and is used to author content, it is only necessary to be specific
to the page/item/assignment/discussion. Name each, in a bulleted list, for which
AI was used as a content-creation assistant.
