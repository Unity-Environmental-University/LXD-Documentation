# Learning Materials

The Learning Materials page is a repository of the week’s content, videos, articles, lectures, etc. The week’s resources are all presented on this page, but may be referenced more specifically in assignments or discussions (e.g., read a specific article and post about it on the discussion board). These pages also contain an editorialization of some kind, such as a title, paragraph describing the resources and how students will use them, a meaningful quote, and/or resource-specific annotations.

Please note that Learning Materials pages should have a lecture video recorded by the SME. Courses designed in the old (non-Curio) style may be missing these lecture videos, but they are a required feature of all new builds. 

Materials such as book chapters, articles, and videos may be arranged a number of ways in the accordions at the bottom of the page. Sometimes they are organized thematically and sometimes they are organized by resource type. However, they are organized, it's helpful to indicate clearly whether each resource is required or supplemental.
