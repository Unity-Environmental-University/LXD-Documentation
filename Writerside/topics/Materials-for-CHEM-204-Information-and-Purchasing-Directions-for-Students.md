# Materials for CHEM 204 Information and Purchasing Directions for Students 

## What is unique about CHEM:204 Organic Chemistry II Lab?
CHEM 204 integrates custom lab kits from the company [Science Interactive (SI)](https://www.scienceinteractive.com/) that have been designed specifically for the course. You are required to purchase a kit that includes laboratory materials (ex: beakers, burners, chemicals, gloves,etc.) to conduct four experiments at home. You will be responsible for supplying additional materials to accompany the kits (ex: oven mitts, distilled water, tinfoil, pie plate, etc.) The purchase of the kit includes access to the lessons from the SI Cloud  through the course in Canvas. These lessons cover getting started, laboratory safety, and the assignments that accompany the experiments.
The lab kits provide you the opportunity to participate in authentic science labs from their homes in a safe manner.
