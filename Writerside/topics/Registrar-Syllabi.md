# Retrieving Syllabi for Registrar's Office
When students ask for a syllabus for a class they took or are looking to take, the Registar's Office will forward the request to LTSS. Below is generally how to retreive that syllabus.

1. Search the requested course or the student in Canvas
    * If it's a course the student has already taken, searching the student can quickly get you to the course the student took, the term they took it.
1. Navigate to course, then syllabus tab in the left course navigation menu.
1. Save the page as a PDF.
1. Attach the PDF in a reply to the Registrar's Office.
