# Retrieving Syllabi for Registrar's Office

When students ask for a syllabus for a class they took or are looking to take, the Registar's Office will forward the request to LTSS. Below is generally how to retreive that syllabus.

1. Search the requested course or the student in Canvas
    - If it's a course the student has already taken, searching the student will bring you to a page with a list of course enrollments. In this list, you will be able to find the course they took specifically, which will lead to the most accurate syllabus.
    - If it's a course for a prospective student, pull the syllabus from the DEV to get the most recent version of the syllabus.
1. Navigate to course, then syllabus tab in the left course navigation menu.
1. Save the page as a PDF.
1. Attach the PDF in a reply to the Registrar's Office.
