# Discussions

- Go to Modules.
- To add a new discussion click the “+” icon in the week you would like to add it. You can also duplicate the existing discussion, but you should duplicate before editing the text or the duplicated discussions edits may affect the original discussion.
- Label the Discussion with a unique name, i.e. do not label it “Week 1 Discussion”.
- In its Settings, be sure to check the “Allow threaded replies” and “Graded” boxes.
- Display grade as “Points”. 
- The default setting for discussion is to mark the box “Users must post before seeing replies”
- Check the “Assignments” to make sure the Discussion you created is in the correct category.
- Confirm the discussion has a rubric with a corresponding title

Be sure to check that the due dates are clearly written in a discussion’s instructions. 

#### Gallery Discussions

There is also an option to create a gallery discussion. This differs from a standard discussion in that students are only required to complete an initial post. They may comment on peers’ initial posts but are not required to.
- There is a gallery discussion template in Week 1 of the DEV_TEMPLATE
- Most gallery discussions are due on Monday, though sometimes they are due on Thursday.
