# GIS Courses

* Courses that incorporate GIS(Geographic Information System) follow a few special guidelines.
* The courses rely on the ArcGIS Pro program. Where possible, link directly to ArcGIS Pro instructions, videos, or other
materials; because the site often updates.

## Onboarding students to the Unity ArcGIS Online License

Note: Check in on Canvas several times throughout the week before courses begin to see if new students have been added 
to each course.
* Monday, Wednesday, and Friday of Week 0
* Monday of Week 1

#### GISC 201 and GISC 505
Subject Line: ArcGIS Pro Installation Instructions

Hello GIS Students,

Before you can start using GIS you need to check that it can run on your computer. If you have a MacBook, please email 
gsiekman@unity.edu ASAP (ArcGIS does not run on macOS systems).

The installation guide for ArcGIS Pro is on Canvas. If you would like to get started ASAP, please follow the attached 
instructions for installing ArcGIS Pro (these instructions are also on the Canvas course page). We recommend starting as
soon as possible since the installation is often the most difficult part of the process, and if your computer does not 
meet the requirements you may need to find a new course for this term.

The most important parts for ArcGIS Pro installation are as follows:

Step 1: Can you run it?

It is mandatory that you check the system requirements of your computer to make sure you can run the software prior to 
taking this course. If you have an older PC, a newer PC that does not meet the minimum requirements, or a Mac, you may 
struggle using the software in this course. Please make arrangements prior to the start of this course to either purchase
a new computer, or borrow a computer. If you have any questions on this, please contact gsiekman@unity.edu

1. Please review the Windows system requirements to run the latest version of 
[ArcGIS Pro](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/get-started/arcgis-pro-system-requirements.htm)
2. After you have reviewed the system requirements, scroll to near the top of the page and click on the "Check your 
computer's ability to run ArcGIS Pro.”  Then, click on the "Can you RUN it" button to check your computer's capability 
to run the GIS software https://links.esri.com/run-arcgis-pro
3. Follow the steps to check your system requirements. When the Detection App completes the hardware scan, your results 
will display.

Step 2: ArcGIS Online

You should have been enrolled in Unity’s ArcGIS organization in GISC 101. If you were not, please send an e-mail to 
Greg Siekman - gsiekman@unity.edu requesting a new invitation to ArcGIS Online.

Step 3: Downloading and Installing the ArcGIS Software

Once you have checked your technology readiness and logged in to ArcGIS online, you will be able to install ArcGIS Pro 
to your computers and get access to the ESRI training website.

1. Download ArcGIS Pro
   * Sign in to your ArcGIS Online organization: https://unityonline.maps.arcgis.com/home/index.html
   * At the top of the page, click your user name and click ‘My settings’.
   * On the My settings page, click the Licenses tab. Your user type, role, and assigned licenses are listed.
   * Next to ArcGIS Pro, click Download. In the Download window, review the Language setting. If you want to download a 
   localized version of ArcGIS Pro, change the setting to the language you want.
   * Click Download. An executable file (.exe) is downloaded to your computer.
2. Open ArcGIS Pro using a “Named User License.” Following the instructions under “Start ArcGIS Pro" here: 
https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/get-started/start-arcgis-pro-with-a-named-user-license.htm  
3. Sign in using your Unity ID and the password that you used to sign in on ArcGIS Online (see Step 2: ArcGIS Online in the previous Canvas module)

Your instructor for the course is as you see in Canvas, but if you have GIS admin-specific questions feel free to email me.

#### GISC 201+ and GISC 505+ {id="gisc-201-and-gisc-505_1"}
Subject Line: Re-installing or returning to GIS
Welcome back to GIS at Unity DE!
The instructions for downloading ArcGIS Pro are below if you need to re-install, although you may not need to change 
anything since you have all taken Unity GIS courses in the past. If it has been awhile, we now use a “Named User License”
rather than the student codes (these codes expire every year). You can download and install ArcGIS Pro and then sign into
it using your ArcGIS Online credentials.

Downloading and Installing the ArcGIS Software
1. Install ArcGIS Pro using the 'Download from ArcGIS Online' instructions (scroll down until you find 'Download from 
   ArcGIS Online') here: https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/get-started/download-arcgis-pro.htm  
   * Sign in to your ArcGIS Online organization: https://unityonline.maps.arcgis.com/home/index.html
   * At the top of the page at the top right, click your profile image/user name and click My settings.
   * On the My settings page, click the Licenses tab. Your user type, role, and assigned licenses are listed.
   * Next to ArcGIS Pro, click Download.
   * In the Download window, review the Language setting. If you want to download a localized version of ArcGIS Pro, 
   change the setting to the language you want. 
   * Click Download. An executable file (.exe) is downloaded to your computer.
3. Open ArcGIS Pro using a “Named User License.” Follow the instructions under “Start ArcGIS Pro" here: 
   https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/get-started/start-arcgis-pro-with-a-named-user-license.htm
4. Sign in using your Unity ID 'Username_UnityOnline' and the password that you used to sign in on ArcGIS Online

Please let me know if you have any questions or run into any trouble with this, I am happy to help.

Thanks,

#### For students to reset their passwords
To reset your own password in ArcGIS Online:
   1. Go to the [ArcGIS Online page](https://unityonline.maps.arcgis.com/home/index.html) and click on your name at the 
   top-right of the screen 
   2. Click on “My settings” 
   3. Click the “Security” tab on the left 
   4. From here you can reset your password

#### Set up ArcGIS on Mac
ArcGIS Pro does not run on OS systems. Currently, we ask students to obtain use of a PC for GIS classes.

That being said, it depends on how motivated you are and how comfortable you are working with computer systems!
ArcGIS Pro can be run on a Macbook using a virtual machine. In order to do that, you would install Boot Camp on your Mac for free,
and you need to buy Windows 10 from unity.onthehub.com (~$15). Downloading Parallels allows you to run both Windows and 
macOS at the same time, switching back and forth. If you just use Boot Camp you need to restart your computer in Windows
mode every time you want to use ArcGIS Pro. https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/get-started/run-pro-on-a-mac.htm

Again, it depends on how comfortable you are testing these things out. I can send more information on how to set up a 
virtual machine if you are interested – I am happy to help! We also have had students borrow friends' computers for this
class.

#### GIS Computer Recommendations
When choosing a computer for ArcGIS Pro, it is important to consider the ArcGIS Pro requirements: 
https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/get-started/arcgis-pro-system-requirements.htm

Generally, gaming laptops tend to be the best ones for GIS work, since the system requirements are similar to ArcGIS 
(high graphics, RAM, and storage). An SSD is also good to have. The specific laptop really depends on your preference.

Here are some sites with recommendations for laptops:
https://blumoo.com/best-gis-laptops/
https://mytravelgadget.com/best-laptops-for-gis-arcgis/
https://freedom251.com/best-laptops-for-arcgis-and-gis/
https://www.salisonline.org/best-laptop-for-gis-and-arcgis/

Desktop:
Dell, HP, and Lenovo all work well with ESRI software. To choose the specific computer model follow the specs they list 
on the ESRI website. Many blogs and posts recommend gaming desktops also:
https://community.esri.com/t5/arcgis-pro-questions/what-s-the-optimal-pc-configuration-for-arcgis-pro/td-p/306607
If you have a brand that you like I would talk to someone at the store or online and ask what they’d recommend based on 
the ESRI specs. Sorry I do not have a specific recommendation but I hope this helps!
