# Envato/Photo Resize Program

With Envato photos, we need to resize the images, so they aren’t as large (file size and dimensions). Here’s a program and instructions to resize a batch of images at once.

## What is this doing?

### The Resizer Script - Best used to make small thumbnails

This script takes some image files (jpg,jpeg,bmp,&gif) from the directory the script is in and resizes them up/down to 500xXXX(whatever to keep the aspect ratio) Its intended purpose is to make big images lower resolution and smaller in visible size.

### The Compressor Script - Best used to save space
This will make large image files (jpg,jpeg,bmp) smaller in file size, not resolution. This is best for images that will need to look good when zooming in. 

> **Warning**

> This will make your files jpeg files.
