# Course Overview Page

The Course Overview page comes before any of the Weekly Modules and unlocks on the first day of the term. Once unlocked, students must view this page and agree to the honor code, code of conduct, and technical requirements before they can proceed to any of the Weekly Modules.

The Course Overview Page has a number of components:
   - Honor Code, Code of Conduct, and Tech for Success
   - Course Description
   - Course Outcomes
   - Syllabus (links to course page)
   - Textbook and Required Materials
   - Course Project Overview (links to course page)
   - Graded Activities
      
      - This is a table that outlines the categories, due dates, and weights of the graded activities. It mirrors the table found on the syllabus, but is populated with greater detail.
