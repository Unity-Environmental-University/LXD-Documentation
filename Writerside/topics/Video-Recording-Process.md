# SME Video Recording Process

>*SMEs will record videos under direction from Creative Media Designer (CMD).*

When the Dean has approved of the Course Project, LXDs should email the SME and CC the CMD using this email template:

Subject: CODE XXX Course Video Production

Hi [SME],

As we prepare to record the course videos for CODE XXX, I'd like to introduce you to our Creative Media Developer (CMD). [Name] will be your point of contact throughout the media production process for the course and is available to answer any questions you may have.

[Name] will follow up on this email to schedule a meeting with you. During this meeting, they will help you get ready to record your course videos. You'll also receive our Course Video Recording Guide, instructions on using Microsoft PowerPoint for recording, and details on our expectations for the slide deck. It is crucial that you review ALL documents shared with you from the CMD, so that we can avoid having to re-recreate any slides or re-record a video.

You will begin by recording the Course Project Overview video, and then you can coordinate with the CMD to plan the rest of the recordings after your Course Project video is approved. Enjoy the process!

Thanks,

[Name]
Learning Experience Designer

Subject: CODE XXX Course Video Production Meeting

Hi [SME],

I hope this message finds you well. My name is [Name], and I'm the Creative Media Developer (CMD) who will be assisting you throughout the media production process for CODE XXX!

I'd like to schedule a meeting with you to discuss the details of your course video recordings and ensure you're fully prepared. During this meeting, we can go over the specifics of the process, answer any questions you may have, and plan out the recording timeline.

To help you get started, here are some key resources:

1. [Course Video Recording Guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EHl1QuT8nLFSeIzlTuKmsLDEb89hELYZ/view)
2. [Instructions for Using Microsoft PowerPoint to Record](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Kgo9vUlU7HS6yZUqnKJvYEzK_J-ZyXf4/view)
3. [Unity Course Video Slide Deck (Please download a copy to your computer)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MhuaRNqdT4cjncp_HCQGUAXgc1qHKDup/edit#slide=id.p137)

Our first priority will be recording the Course Project video. After that, we can work together to plan and schedule the remaining recordings.

Please let me know your availability, and I'll set up a time that works best for you. Looking forward to collaborating on this project!

Prior to our meeting, please ensure you are familiar with the above documents and take note of any questions you have on the course video production process.

Best,

Creative Media Developer

### Next Steps for CMD: 

- **Work** in parallel with the SME in producing the course project video while the LXD and SME continue working on the Course Outline. 
- **Support and guide** the SME in producing as high quality a video as possible, then send the video to the dean for feedback / approval.
- **Assess the SME for their presentation capabilities**. If it doesn’t seem like they are going to be capable of doing a good job recording course videos, the CMD should draw attention to that with the Dir. of LXD and the relevant Dean(s).
- **Edit** the Course Project video and let the LXD and SME know when it has been approved by the dean so that the SME can begin recording weekly overviews. 

### Next Steps for LXD:
Upon completion (the Dean signs off on the course outline), the LXD will:
- **Connect** the SME with the CMD, this time with an accompanying Video Outline Sheet Template, in which the LXD and SME should list the projected video recordings needed (the CMD and SME can add to this if needed; this is just to get an idea of the scope). 
- **Communicate** to the SME and CMD what the deadline for media should be, given the needs of the development at that time. This should not be more than 1 month, and should preferably be 2 weeks or less, from the time when the Video Outline Sheet Template is filled out. 
- **Refine** the course outline and start building the course in Canvas while CMD works with the SME to record the remaining videos. 
- **Remain** in regular contact with CMD about the SME and the status of the course development throughout this time. 
  - The LXD might still request to meet with the SME weekly to work on any remaining tasks (instructor guides, answer keys, supplemental materials, etc.)

### Upon Completion of Video Development:
Upon completion of the videos, CMD will upload them into Canvas Studio under the CMD Canvas User’s account, directly in the course. They can then be populated within the course by LXD as they complete building the course out in Canvas.
