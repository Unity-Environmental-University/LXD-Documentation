# Assignments

- Go to Modules.
- To add a new assignment click the “+” icon in the week you would like to add it. You can also duplicate the existing assignment, but you should duplicate before editing the text or the duplicated assignments edits may affect the original assignment.
- Label the Assignment with a unique name, i.e. do not label it “Week 1 Assignment”.
- Include a banner image. 
  - Check the shared Drive Folder “Course Photos by Subject” for images
  - Envato and Unsplash are other sources for banner images.
  - Resize image if large
- The default settings are to “Allow File Uploads” and “Submission Attempts: Unlimited”. You may check a different submission type (besides file upload) depending on the nature of the assignment. However, a box must be checked or no submission is permitted.
  - Other submission options include: Text Entry, Website URL, media recordings, student annotation
  - Text entry is a basic text box for typing a written submission, but also allows students to upload files. Sometimes, students may wish to include a note to their instructor along with their file submission.
  - Website URL may be used to share a GoogleDrive or Youtube link to a video presentation, for example
  - Note: depending on the assignment, students should still submit written work as a file upload, rather than a Drive link to ensure the instructor has access, the work isn’t changed after submission, and feedback can be given via Canvas.
- Display grade as “Points”.
- Check the “Assignments” to make sure the Assignment you created is in the correct category.
- Confirm the assignment has a rubric with the corresponding title.
- Assignment categories in Canvas appear on the Syllabus page.

Note: The percent breakdown of grading categories, seen in the Syllabus, is filled via the Assignments page (in the left sidebar menu in Canvas) and is not editable on the syllabus page even though it appears there.
