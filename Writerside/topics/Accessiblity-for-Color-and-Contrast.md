# Accessibility for Color and Contrast 

**Accessibility for Color and Contrast** 

- [This tool](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/?fcolor=E99116&bcolor=151414
  ) can be used to check for color contrast accessibility. 

  - To check a page/assignment/discussion/quiz for color accessibility, go to the EDIT button that you are checking. 
  - Switch to HTML ![HTML.jpg](HTML.JPG)
  - Look for the HTML code of the content you’d like to check. It should be near the text you are assessing and should say “color: #_ _ _ _ _ _ ;” (numbers or letters). Copy the hexcode. Example:  #e03e2d
  - Use the contrast checker by pasting the hexcode into the AIM tool for Foreground:

  - Next, add the background. The code for white is #FFFFFF and    
    black is #000000.

  -  Check to see if the contrast passed or failed. 
  - If it fails, move the Lightness slider (blue slider) until all the text says Pass. The color below passed because it is darker.

  - Copy and paste the new hexcode, including the # symbol, to replace the previous color. Add the hexcode to all the spots in the HTML in the page/assignment/discussion/quiz.
    - Note: While the HTML is open, you can click Ctrl + F to highlight all the instances in the HTML where you will need to change the color. Do this by replacing the original HTML color code: #e03e2d with the new #972A20
