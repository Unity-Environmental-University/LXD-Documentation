# Weekly Overview Pages

Weekly Overview pages come at the start of each Weekly Module. They have four major components:

1. Weekly Title
2. Overview narrative

   This typically summarizes the content students will learn that week. The Overviews should be informative and explain why students are about to learn the topics in the week. The Overviews may also cover the assignments, discussions, Course Project components, and other assessments of the week.

3. Weekly Objectives
4. This Week’s Activities

   This is automatically populated in Canvas and includes a list of the Week’s discussions, assignments, quizzes, etc.
