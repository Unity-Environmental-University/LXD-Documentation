# Weekly Overview Pages

Weekly Overview pages come at the start of each Weekly Module. They have four major components:

1. Weekly Title
2. Overview narrative

   This typically summarizes, in broad strokes, the content students will learn that week. The Overviews should be informative and explain why students are about to learn the topics in the week. The Overviews may also cover the assignments, discussions, Course Project components, and other assessments of the week. This differs from the Learning Materials annotations, which tell students how to approach the learning materials and/or how the materials will be used.

3. Weekly Objectives
4. This Week’s Activities

   This is automatically populated in Canvas and includes a list of the Week’s discussions, assignments, quizzes, etc. 

## Weekly Overview and Objectives

These landing pages are found at the beginning of each
weekly module.

### Overviews

- The **Overview** offers a roadmap for the week’s
content and tasks and how they intersect. 
SMEs can make more direct references to their pedagogical 
choices in the overview and clarify the beginning and end 
points of the week’s lessons.

### Objectives

- Each week has defined **weekly objectives** that orient the
students to what they will learn and accomplish each week. 
The weekly objectives contribute to the overall course 
outcomes in smaller or more specific elements.
