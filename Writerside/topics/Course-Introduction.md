## Course Introduction
The Course Introduction, found on the Homepage of the course, offers the students the first entry point into the course after the Course Description. While some of the overview of content might be the same, this is a space where the narrative of the course can come alive or for the SME to offer some of their “voice” to the course.

Here are some questions for the SME to consider when drafting the Course Introduction:
- What are the main themes or topics of the course?
- What are common conceptions, misconceptions of this topic?
  - If appropriate, what isn’t the course?
- What is the Course Project?
- What about the topic(s) excites them, as the course designer? 
- How do the pieces of the course come together?
  - How does the course project fit into that? 
- What is the “arc” of the course, from beginning to end?
- What real world applications or experiences will students gain from this course?
- What will students learn?

The above questions are found in the Course Outline template. You might also consider making a video as the Course Introduction that answers the same questions.
