# Audits

Courses occasionally undergo the auditing process, which is when an LXD goes through all the course components and offers specific feedback to the different sections of the course. This is beyond the scope of a more typical update and may result in a course refresh or overhaul. The Deans typically assign audits with Trello cards. Audits are often based on the original development date of courses (older courses are audited to re-align to design standards), though LXDs and LTSSs can flag courses for Audit after an update or based on instructor feedback
  

1. Create a new Google doc from **[this document ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wtcodQMxWw0HmuhsmRAD0a_azQbQEZRoi4EdPwbio6w/edit)** by copying the template and titling it with  “Course Code Audit” (ex: COMM 201 Audit). 

2. Move the document to the course folder (or create the document directly in that folder) so that the team can access the audit, if needed. 

3. Open the DEV course in Canvas. Create a link in the Google doc to the DEV. 

4. Click through and read everything in the course.
      
   - Include all the bolded categories paying special attention to: Takeaways/Key Points, Suggestions for Specific Improvements, and Options for Moving Forward 

        - Note: A rebuild often is needed when the Course Project needs a complete change, assignments don’t scaffold, Course Outcomes and description need adjustment, if the course is not rigorous enough, to name a few.
          
        - Note: A refresh might be that the Course Project is fine, but some of the assignments and rubrics are in need of modification, learning materials are outdated, there are not enough assignments or too many, to name a few.
      
        - Note: Follow the Update checklist as a guide, but go further by reviewing and evaluating instructions/assignments.

5. Send the Audit to the assigned Dean.

6. Questions to keep in mind when auditing a course:

   - Are the learning objectives (both for the course and the individual weeks) appropriate for a ______ level course?

   - Do the activities (discussions, assignments, quizzes, labs) align with the weekly learning objectives?

   - Are the learners “acting upon” the learning objectives?

   - Is there an experiential aspect to the course?

   - Does the course accomplish what it is supposed to according to the course description? (or learning objectives)

   - Are the weeks balanced in terms of workload?

   - Do the learning activities engage the learners?

   - Are directions for activities comprehensive and easily understood for both students and instructors?

   - Do discussions encourage discussion?

   - Is the workload appropriate?  The 5-week, 3-credit course averages to about 25 hours per course per week according to the registrar*. 3-week courses should be 40 hours of work per week for student

   - Are there external resources that enrich the learning of the students?

   - Are there external resources utilized that we could do a better job of developing ourselves?

   - Are multiple viewpoints and perspectives represented?

   - Is there a well-designed and scaffolded Course Project?

   - Are the learning materials (and activities) still relevant in the discipline, or have there been new discoveries or practices?

   - Has there been feedback in the Course Edits Feedback Form spreadsheet about the course?

   - If students use AI to complete this assignment, how can we ensure they are still meeting the course objects and expected rigor?

   - If students use AI to complete an assignment/discussion, where is their learning?

   - How could/should students use AI in the course assignments and discussions
