# Announcements

Instructors use announcements throughout the term to **engage with students, send reminders, or provide updates**. Instructors can also use announcements for a more personal touch or to connect with students during the course. 

They are required by Unity instructor guidelines to post at least **one announcement per week,** but these are typically written by the instructors for each term (rather than copied in the DEV/BP from term to term). 

Sometimes corrections or errors arise during the course run, and in these instances announcements can be used to disseminate information to all students in the course (such as an updated link or file, a change in an assignment/discussion, etc.).

Some courses contain “pre-loaded” announcements that are kept and used term to term: 
- These often contain time-released information, such as the source for a case study after it has been discussed, the end of a scenario that was analyzed, or further context for a course topic/theme.
- These announcements used the “delay posting until” feature which is changed term to term.

> When posting announcements, there is a box with the option “Post to” and “All Sections”. Instructors can disregard this, even when there are multiple sections, because Unity uses a different method to create multiple sections of a course, so one instructor’s announcements will not go to the other sections (even when they are the instructor for multiple sections).
