# Familiarizing with the Writerside File Structure

## Overview
Review of the File Structure within Writerside.

Understanding the file structure is crucial for efficient document management and navigation.
This guide provides an overview of the typical file structure and best practices
for organizing your documentation projects.

## Best Practices for File Organization

<!--Here's some xml mixed with markdown for mixed use example-->
### Project Files
The main places to familiarize yourself with are the "topics" and "images" folders. Topics are automatically added
to the "topics" folder. When adding images, be sure to keep them organized.

>While images don't need to be placed in the images folder, continuity will help overall.

### Consistent Naming
- Use clear and descriptive file names.
- Follow a naming convention, like `TopicName-Subtopic.md`.
>Be sure to _**avoid spaces**_ when naming files, as they don't play nice with xml & markdown
> Example: Use `file_name` rather than ~~`file name`~~
>{style=warning}

### Default file types

.md files
: `topic.md` files are markdown files. They can still use xml, but they start out as markdown files

.topic files
: `topic.topic` files are xml files. They cannot use markdown.
