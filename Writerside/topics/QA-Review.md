# Quality Assurance Review
Once the course is built in Canvas, a thorough review of the course from the user experience takes place. SMEs are given 1 week to look through the entire course, looking for any errors or issues.
- The ID assigns the SME to the Quality Assurance role in Canvas.
    - Go to “People” in the course’s DEV shell.
    - Appoint the SME the role of “Course Q&A” by typing in their email, then clicking “add”, which will result in the SME getting a canvas email and they will see the course in their canvas dashboard. You can verify they have the QA role because it will show them as pending until they accept the invite.
    - Send an email to the SME and the Dean to let them know the course is ready for QA. There is a QA email template.
- The SME has one week to review the course making sure to focus on content, correctness, and functionality. In addition, the SME will check all links, videos, discussions, rubrics, gradebook, etc.
- The ID will provide the SME with a QA checklist.
- Make changes before copying to the BP. 

**Outcome(s):**
- The course has been built in Canvas and QA’d
- The deans are clued in that the SME is QAing it. Once they've done so, the development is complete.
- The course is ready for blueprinting
