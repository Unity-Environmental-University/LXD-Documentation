# Quality Assurance Review
Once the course is built in Canvas, a thorough review of the course from the user experience takes place. SMEs are given 1 week to look through the entire course, looking for any errors or issues.
1. The ID assigns the SME to the Quality Assurance role in Canvas. 
    - Go to “People” in the course’s DEV shell. 
    - Appoint the SME the role of “Course Q&A” by typing in their email, then clicking “add”. The SME will receive an email from Canvas, and see the course in their canvas dashboard. 
    - It will show them as pending until they accept the invite. 
2. Send an email to the SME and the Dean to let them know the course is ready for QA using [this email template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EnO5nX2CvNVkpvtp2yMEeEchIK0mFt75HdjuzJhdbiw/edit). 
   - The SME has one week to review the course making sure to focus on content, correctness, and functionality. In addition, the SME will check all links, videos, discussions, rubrics, gradebook, etc. 
   - The ID will provide the SME with a copy of the  [QA checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RIywawLQCVyV86KA-LrNTotbpkTbEq6ItasxuVriMDE/edit).
3. Once the QA check is complete, make changes before copying to the BP. 

**Outcome(s):**
- The course has been built in Canvas and QA’d by the SME
- The deans are informed that the SME is QAing it. Once they've done so, the development is complete.
- The course is ready for blueprinting
