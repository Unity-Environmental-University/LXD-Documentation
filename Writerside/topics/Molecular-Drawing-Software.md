# Molecular Drawing Software

For some assignments, you will need to draw up a molecular structure and/or reaction mechanism of different molecules. We suggest these software options:
1. [ChemDraw Direct](https://chemdrawdirect.perkinelmer.cloud/js/sample/index.html) (Browser based)
ChemDraw Direct will work in your browser no matter whether you are using a Mac or a PC. It is more basic than other options, but should offer plenty of functionality for this course.
Here is the [User Guide](https://chemdrawdirect.perkinelmer.cloud/js/docs/User%20Guide/ChemDraw%20JS.htm) for ChemDraw
2. [ChemSketch Program download](https://www.acdlabs.com/resources/freeware/chemsketch/index.php) (Windows only)
This link leads you to a download of a Windows-only software. This link to the site sites also has video tutorials on different functionalities of the software.
3. [BK Chem open Source Software](http://bkchem.zirael.org/download_en.html)
If you are interested in more powerful visualization software, and are not averse to using an open-source program to do it, then BK Chem is also an option for both Macs and PCs. It is not as easy to use as the options provided above, but it is more broadly functional.

The interface for the software is generally the same, where you can draw bond line structures of the molecules and add different atoms or functional groups to change the molecular structure. Drag and draw the shapes with your mouse to create the molecule or mechanism. There are also 3D line options to create chiral centers and stereoisomers of molecules, where needed.

When finished, save your drawing as a .jpeg, ideally with the file title [Name.Molecule/Reaction Name]. You will then upload this image to Canvas for your assignment. You may also add the image directly into your project documents or presentation.
