# Update Process

## Getting an existing course right prior to it running

Updates are just a maintenance pass through existing courses before they run again. Updating dates, checking links, making sure DE-wide standardizations (such as specific wording in the syllabi) are propagated everywhere they need to be. In the case of broken links, the original SME who designed the course may be consulted to replace the link with an adequate new resource. Reach out to the appropriate Dean if you need any guidance on who to reach out to. The dean may also refer you to the current course instructor if the SME has moved on.

To complete updates for a course, follow the Update Checklist found in Trello.
- Go to the course card in [Trello](https://trello.com/b/7Ozmsgta/course-roll-outs).
- Select "Update Checklist" under "Automation in the card's sidebar.
- The most recent form of the checklist will auto-populate the card.
<note>Any last-minute additions/changes to the checklist won't populate what you have in the card. Stay aware of any such last-minute changes to the checklist, and where they're captured. </note>

This list contains tasks to get the course ready for its next run, such as changing the dates or other stylistic changes such as syllabus language.
Notes about items on the Update Checklist:
- Check links: test all internal and external links in a Canvas course. If an external link is broken and you cannot replace it, reach out to the Dean associated with the course to find a replacement/put you in contact with the SME.

If a bigger picture change emerges during the update process, make a note on the Trello card for the next time the course runs. Find the card, flag issues for next time, @ the dean in the course card. The deans will see the note and determine if the course merits a refresh as opposed to an update, or if a more significant redesign is required. With the timeline of an update, focus is on what is pragmatically possible at that moment. Depending on the course’s next run and the scale of the change, the deans will recommend different courses of action.

## DEV to BP to Live Sections Copy Process

Follow the directions laid out in the [Copying, Syncing and Writing Process](Copying.md), specifically under "Creating a BP from a DEV, and archiving old BPs."
<note>The process for copying, syncing and publishing courses as part of updates changed <strong>5.15.24</strong></note>

## Glossary

### Types of sections in Canvas

DEV_ (in the Distance Education Canvas Subaccount)
: These are the master copies of each unique course. They all have course ids that have the prefix “DEV_.” They are internal for our team and do not have students or active instructors. Before each term start, for each course, we get the DEV section right and then copy it over to the Blueprint (BP) copy of the course, from which we push the content into the live sections. The DEV is always the latest version of any course. Even if a fix is too late to make in the live section itself, we make the fix in the DEV for future terms. When we’re updating courses, we make the updates in the DEVs.

BP_ (in the Distance Education Canvas Subaccount)
: Blueprints are where all content is staged to be pushed into the live sections. No students or instructors are in the blueprints. Before each term, blueprints are
1) Unassociated with the live sections from the previous term (this is done by going to Settings and turning off Blueprint functionality in the BP);
2) Reset (go to Settings and then click “Reset Course Content”) to remove all the content and due dates from the previous term;
3) And imported with the content from the DEV_ copies, where all the most recent improvements have been made and the due dates have been updated.
   The sequence is: DEV-> BP-> Live Sections. Blueprints allow us to make changes to all sections at once, rather than going to each one individually. If there is an issue in a live course that needs to be addressed immediately, make the change in the BP and then push that change out to all the sections, thus fixing the issue everywhere.

(Term code prefix) Live sections - where the learning happens (in the Distance Education Canvas Subaccount)
: These are the live courses with the students and faculty. Course codes have two formats
- DE5W01.08.24 for Undergrad
- DE8W01.08.24 for Grad
  : The one thing that is always different in the live sections from what is in the BP copy of any given course is the Homepage. Before each term start, we’ll update the Homepage with the instructor photo and bio for the instructor assigned to that section.
