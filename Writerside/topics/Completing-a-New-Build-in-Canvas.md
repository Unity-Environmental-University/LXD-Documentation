# Completing a New Build in Canvas

1. Create the Dev Shell for the course by importing content from the DEV_Template
2. Keep or delete Weeks 6-8 depending on if it is a grad course or not
   - Delete the week 6-8 pages (by clicking “pages”) and discussions/assignments (by clicking “assignments”)
3. Duplicate the existing Assignment/Discussions in each week in Canvas to match the number of Assignments, Disc etc. found in the Google Doc Outline
4. Edit the Weekly titles in for each module (found in the “Modules View” at the top of each module under the “Week #”)
5. Copy and paste all weekly overviews, objectives, Learning materials, assignments/discussion, and Course Project into Canvas from the Google Doc
    - Populate the Course Overview and Course Project pages that are linked in the course homepage.
    - Download any files in drive and upload them to the learning materials pages (do not use shared drive links/shared files you have linked in Google)
    - Quizzes, if you have any, may need to be imported from the item bank or added to Canvas with [Canvas Quiz Converter](http://ec2-34-207-154-191.compute-1.amazonaws.com/)
    - Upload edited SME's MP4 or other video files to Canvas Studio, and add the Unity DE logo as the thumbnail.
    - Canvas Studio automatically creates for each video, but it’s a good idea to review them briefly and fix any errors.
    - Add the rubrics for each assignment/discussion, be sure to click “Use this rubric for grading”
6. Create links between Course Project and Scaffold assignments/discussions
    - Click “insert”/the link icon then “Course link” → this will preserve the links when copied to the bp/live
7. Add pictures to each page that has stock photos 
    - Use [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) and/or [Envato](https://elements.envato.com/photos) for pictures
8. If a grad course, set Grading scheme (the default is undergrad)
9. Edit the syllabus to include the course outcomes, description, and Week 1 Learning Materials preview
10. Select the correct grading table and delete the incorrect one (G/UG)
11. Edit the homepage to have the course title
12. Add the “Course introduction” to the home page, edit “This is going to be a great course” to something else
13. Edit the Grade weighting of the different categories by clicking “Assignments” in the left side bar, then clicking the Assignment Groups Weight for each grading category
14. Go through Update Checklist if the course is running
15. Before copying over to the BP, go to settings, and click “Validate links” to make sure all the Canvas links are properly set up in the course
