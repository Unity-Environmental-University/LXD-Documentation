# Process Manual Introduction

## Educational Institution

Unity Environmental University Distance Education

## Introduction
This Process Manual is a guide for new and tenured LXDs at Unity Environmental University. It will be updated should processes, philosophy, and standards change.

## Purpose
The purpose of the Unity Learning Experience Design (LXD) Process Manual is to provide new designers the philosophical and pedagogical background of the design process. This guide offers the 30,000 foot perspective on design: rationale, major milestones, and foundational components. This document will work in tandem with the Technical Manual, which offers stepwise, granular instructions for course design processes. While that document will be frequently updated to reflect the changing and evolving technology we employ, this document offers a stable, more consistent jumping off point for the philosophy of our design. While our tools may change, our vision will not. The audience for this document is more external-facing to Deans, SMEs, LXDs, LTSS, and potentially other constituents, whereas the Technical Manual serves the LXD team.
