# Quizzes

Students may complete quizzes as part of their coursework, 
but these often differ from in-person models. Quizzes should 
only be formative assessments used to advance student learning. 
Due to the medium, they are open book and untimed, with 
multiple attempts.

Generally, quizzes should not count for more than 20% of 
the overall course grade because the online asynchronous 
medium should deemphasize summative assessments in the 
form of quizzes. Instead, quizzes should offer students the 
opportunity to practice and refine knowledge (a formative 
assessment). 

Students should be allowed at least two attempts 
on a quiz and as such quizzes should have at least a 2:1 
ratio of questions created to the number of questions on the 
quiz. If quizzes are valued at too high a percentage of the 
overall grade, this actually encourages students to cheat as 
a way to maintain their grade, but lower the percentage 
signals a lower stakes opportunity to learn. Some exceptions 
apply for quiz length and grading percentage, such as math 
courses or graduate versus undergraduate courses.
