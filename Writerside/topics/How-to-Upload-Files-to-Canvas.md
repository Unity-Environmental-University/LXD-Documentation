- Go to “Files” in the menu bar on the left hand side.

- Depending on the file, you may need to create a folder. Be sure there are subfolders.
  - “Course Readings” → “Week 1 Readings”
  - “Images” → “Week 1 Images”

- Typically, readings, worksheets, handouts, etc. are uploaded as PDFs. However, this depends on the course. Word documents may be more appropriate if students need to edit and work in the uploaded file.
- Once the file is uploaded you can hyperlink to it in the desired Canvas page.
  - Go to the page you’d like to insert the hyperlink.
  - Highlight the text you would like to hyperlink. You can also find a blank line and insert the link from the sidebar.
    - Click the link icon from the menu bar and select “course links”.
    - Go to the right sidebar and select “Files” from the dropdown menu. Click the item you want to link to. Note: Pages will also contain Assignments
    - Do not copy the Canvas url because this will break or not transfer over when others click the link.
  - Search for the file name and click.
  - The selected text should now be hyperlinked.

- Click “Save” at the bottom of the page to view the hyperlink. It should appear as green text with no icons after the link. Previously, there was either a paper with a magnifying glass icon or a download arrow, but we did not want those to appear.
