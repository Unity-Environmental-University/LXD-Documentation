## Academic Calendars

[DE Academic Calendar](https://unity.edu/distance-education/admissions-costs-aid/academic-calendar/)

The DE academic calendar encompasses both graduate and undergraduate programs. Graduate classes run on 8-week terms and undergraduate on 5-week terms.

Nomenclature for undergraduate terms follows this example: DE-24-Apr, which designates the SEBU (DE), the calendar year (2024), and the starting month of the course (April). 

Nomenclature for graduate terms follows this example: DE8W03.11.24, which designates the SEBU (DE), the duration of the term (8 weeks), and the first date of the term. 

The academic calendars are available [here on the Unity website](https://unity.edu/distance-education/admissions-costs-aid/academic-calendar/)
