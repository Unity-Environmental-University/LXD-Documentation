## Introduction
The LXD Documentation site is a collection of processes and policies for course development. The site is divided into two parts: 
- This Getting Started section, which goes more deeply into why we do things the way we do them, how different roles may be broken up, and foundational philosophies. 
- The [](Technical-Manual.md) section, which goes into more granular depth on specific standards, tools, processes, resources, peculiarities, etc. to do with course design and maintenance.


## Purpose
The purpose of the LXD Documentation site is to provide Learning Designers (LDs), Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) and other IAPs a comprehensive picture of 
how we do things, why we do them that way, and what tools we're using to get them done. The Assistant Director of LXD is the Editor in Chief of LXD Documentation, but
LDs may be appointed at any time to take specific roles in revising and/or adding to this record.
