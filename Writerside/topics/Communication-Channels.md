# Communication Channels
**Teams**

Most communication with other LXDs, LTSSs, and the Deans occurs in the Teams chat. General questions can be posed in the The Mighty LXD Team Chat and someone will get back to you. If you have a question for a specific person, you can message them directly. In addition to email, Deans are also easily reached via Teams for questions, but workflow related items should be logged in Trello to keep track of the process.
Meetings occur via Teams while we are working remotely. This applies for our meetings with SMEs in other locations.

**Other Options for Video Calls**
- For interviews with candidates, HR will use set up Zoom calls.
- If a SME is having tech issues with Teams, you can set up a Google Meet instead.

**Email**

Email is the best way to correspond with SMEs outside of the Teams video calls.
