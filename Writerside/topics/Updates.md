# Updates

Updates are just a maintenance pass through existing courses before they run again. Updating dates, checking links, making sure DE-wide standardizations (such as specific wording in the syllabi) are propagated everywhere they need to be. In the case of broken links, the original SME who designed the course may be consulted to replace the link with an adequate new resource. Reach out to the appropriate Dean if you need any guidance on who to reach out to. The dean may also refer you to the current course instructor if the SME has moved on.

To complete updates for a course, follow the Update Checklist found in Trello.
- Go to the course card in Trello.
- Click “Checklist” on the right hand side.
- “Copy Items From” the “Course Builds” checklist.

This list contains tasks to get the course ready for its next run, such as changing the dates or other stylistic changes such as syllabus language.
Notes about items on the Update Checklist:
- Check links: test all internal and external links in a Canvas course. If an external link is broken and you cannot replace it, reach out to the Dean associated with the course to find a replacement/put you in contact with the SME.

If a bigger picture change emerges during the update process, make a note on the Trello card for the next time the course runs. Find the card, flag issues for next time, @ the dean in the course card. The deans will see the note and determine if the course merits a refresh as opposed to an update, or if a more significant redesign is required. With the timeline of an update, focus is on what is pragmatically possible at that moment. Depending on the course’s next run and the scale of the change, the deans will recommend different courses of action.
