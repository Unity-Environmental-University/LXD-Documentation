# Running an Outcomes Report

An Outcomes Report collects student data from courses that use the "Outcomes" feature in Canvas (represented by rubrics with the "target" icon).
These reports are generated by Canvas and demonstrate students' progress towards meeting the outcomes.

     - For example, you can select a term to see all the outcomes assessed during that term
      
     - You can also select all terms, then outcomes to see a report of all outcomes run across terms
