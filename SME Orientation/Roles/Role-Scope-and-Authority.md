# Role, Scope and Authority

## Collaborative Development Model

The Course Development process relies on collaboration between the SME and the LXD. The SME brings deep content expertise and field knowledge, while the LXD brings pedagogical expertise and project management. Together, they create courses that balance content rigor with instructional quality.

- **The SME** contributes content knowledge, relevant professional activities or tasks, standard terminology and nomenclature, and the canonical or foundational resources (journal articles, books, etc.) of the field.
- **The LXD** leads the SME through the design process with a particular focus on content delivery, instructional design, and student engagement.

The LXD and SME conceptualize the design and delivery of the course to enhance, promote, and facilitate student engagement with the content and set timelines.

## Decision-Making Authority

Clear authority structures ensure efficient decision-making while maintaining quality standards:

### Learning Experience Designer (LXD) - Development Authority
The **LXD has primary authority** over course design decisions during development, including:
- Pedagogical choices (activity types, assessment formats, sequencing)
- Course structure and organization
- Student-facing language and instructions
- Learning technology implementation

This authority ensures courses maintain pedagogical integrity and align with Unity's standards.

### Academic Dean - Ultimate Authority and Veto Power
The **Dean has ultimate authority** over curriculum decisions and can veto any course element or design choice. The Dean's responsibilities include:
- Curriculum alignment and program coherence
- Academic rigor and accreditation standards
- Course content approval at key milestones
- Final sign-off on all course components before delivery

The Dean may request changes or rework at any major milestone (Course Outcomes approval, Course Project approval, Draft Design review, Final QA approval).

### Working Together
In practice, LXDs and Deans work collaboratively. The LXD makes day-to-day design decisions in consultation with the SME, and the Dean reviews these decisions at key milestones. If the Dean and LXD disagree, the Dean's decision prevails. If the Dean and LXD agree but the SME has concerns, the LXD facilitates discussion but maintains design authority.

**Note:** Unity has final say on all design choices because the course and its content are ultimately Unity Property.

When designing course content, LXDs want to allow for a SME’s creativity and flexibility to infuse real world relevance
to the activities. At the same time, the LXD must consider the feasibility of completing such tasks in an online,
asynchronous environment. One useful method is for the SME and LXD to collaboratively draft a discussion to demonstrate
the required format, and then the SME can work to develop subsequent discussions with their expertise and the desired
format. A similar process also works for developing assignments, which require detailed, student-facing directions.

## Team Roles and Responsibilities
Course development is a highly collaborative process. The Learning Experience Design Team is responsible for the design,
development, management and support of all online programs in cooperation with the following roles:

### **Academic Dean (D)**
The Academic Dean is responsible for the ongoing development and implementation of a specific program and the academic
experience of the program’s students. Related to course development, the Academic Dean is responsible for the following
activities:
- Hiring and supervising faculty and subject-matter experts
- Establishing the program level learning outcomes
- Leading the decisions on the content of the curriculum
- Aligning curriculum with Accreditation standards
- Approving multiple course milestones
- Designing new degree programs

### **Learning Experience Designer (LXD)**
The Learning Experience Designer is responsible for project management and collaboration with Deans,
Subject Matter Experts, faculty, fellow LXDs, LTSSs, and other IAPs to maintain, update, refresh, redesign and build
online learning experiences for a variety of courses while also supporting online instructors as they teach a course.
The LXD brings considerable pedagogical experience and expertise.

They work directly with Subject Matter Experts in envisioning new courses and proposing substantial revisions to
existing courses to maximize student engagement and learning, to facilitate excellent online teaching, and to advance
the institution’s goal of providing world-class online education.

- The LXD develops or captures the information needed to create the course deliverables and provides feedback on how to
  shape content into a pedagogically sound course. This work includes:
    - Working with Subject Matter Experts to ensure content is expressed clearly to maximize student learning based on
      standards defined by instructional design models.
    - Articulating measurable outcomes and objectives determined by Subject Matter Experts and Deans
    - Collaborating with Subject Matter Experts on the creation of engaging and outcome-aligned real-world accessible
      activities and assessments. LXDs may propose an assignment or discussion format to best showcase content and to best
      assess student learning.
    - Building and supporting courses within the Learning Management System

### **Learning Technology Support Specialist (LTSS)**
The Learning Technology Support Specialist is responsible for the media in the course. This primarily consists of
editing the SME-created videos, but can also extend to designing or formatting slides as well as exploring technology
solutions for the course.

Ultimately, course design is the responsibility of the learning experience designer, and they can make the final call on
the different course elements, such as an assignment deliverable, discussion post wording, or rubric format.


### **Subject Matter Expert (SME)**
The Subject Matter Expert guides course development by providing expertise and experience in a content area to develop
original content. They collaborate with the Dean, LXD, and LTSS to ensure the course covers key topics, concepts, and
knowledge as it relates to the field and to students. The SME’s work includes:
- Providing vision for the course in order to develop course-level outcomes that map to program-level outcomes
- Choosing course materials and related content that is relevant to the field and is directly related to the course
  outcomes
- Creating content that develops a learner’s skills and knowledge of the field of study
- Aligning assignments, discussion, and the Course Project with real world experiences and relevant professional tasks
  or products
- Ensuring quality assurance of course content and delivery
- Working in concert with the LXD team members to execute the creation of the course components
