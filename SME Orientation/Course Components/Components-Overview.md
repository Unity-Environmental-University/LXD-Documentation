# Course Components and Alignment

## The Alignment Model

At Unity DE, every component of a course is intentionally aligned to support student learning. This alignment starts with course-level outcomes and flows through every assessment and learning activity.

```
Program Outcomes
        ↓
Course Outcomes
        ↓
Weekly Outcomes (implicit in activities)
        ↓
Graded Activities (Projects, Assignments, Discussions, Quizzes)
        ↓
Learning Materials (Reading, Videos, Media)
```

### Understanding the Alignment Chain

**Course Outcomes** describe what students will be able to do at the end of the course. All course outcomes should be:
- Aligned to **Program Outcomes** (your degree's overall goals)
- Written as "Students will be able to..." (emphasizing skills over knowledge)
- Measurable and assessable
- Achievable within the course scope

**Graded Activities** are the primary assessment tools. They directly measure whether students have met course outcomes. Every graded activity should:
- Map to one or more course outcomes
- Provide evidence of student learning
- Scaffold progressively (building skills across the term)
- Include clear rubrics aligned to outcomes

**Learning Materials** support students in developing the knowledge and skills needed to complete graded activities. These materials are not assessed separately but enable success in assessments.

## Types of Graded Activities

Unity DE courses typically include four types of graded activities, each serving different pedagogical purposes:

### 1. Course Project

The **Course Project** is the capstone assessment of the course. It's a cumulative, real-world deliverable that synthesizes learning from the entire course.

**Characteristics:**
- Represents an authentic product or task from the discipline
- Scaffolded across the entire course (components completed as assignments/discussions)
- Aligns to multiple course outcomes
- Often includes written, presentation, and/or digital components
- Student work is unique and individually produced

**Instructor Expectations:**
- Course Project Overview page clearly explains the project, audience, scenario, and learning value
- Project components are scaffolded throughout the course with regular checkpoints
- Clear rubrics (usually holistic or analytic) that align to course outcomes
- Realistic timelines that allow time for revision and feedback
- Connection to professional practice or real-world application

**Example Projects:**
- Lab Report (Life Sciences)
- Grant Proposal (Ecology)
- Environmental Management Plan (Environmental Science)
- Marketing Plan (Business)

### 2. Assignments

**Assignments** are focused learning activities that develop specific skills and knowledge. Unlike discussions, assignments typically have a single correct or well-defined answer.

**Characteristics:**
- Focus on skill application (analysis, synthesis, evaluation, creation)
- Include clear, detailed instructions that don't require additional explanation
- Vary in format (essays, problem sets, case analyses, short responses, etc.)
- May be individual steps toward the Course Project or standalone assessments
- Graded using rubrics that specify expectations

**Instructor Expectations:**
- Student-facing directions must be thorough and self-contained
- Assignments should require higher-order thinking (Bloom's Analysis, Synthesis, Evaluation)
- Clear purpose connected to course outcomes
- Authentic tasks when possible (real-world application)
- Consistent formatting and structure across the course
- Rubrics provide specific, actionable feedback criteria

**Format Examples:**
- Essay or short-answer response
- Case study analysis
- Problem-solving task
- Project component (data collection, research, design element)
- Reflection or application activity

### 3. Discussions

**Discussions** are collaborative learning activities where students share ideas, critique perspectives, and learn from peers.

**Characteristics:**
- Usually follow a consistent format: initial post + response posts
- Promote peer learning and diverse viewpoints
- Build community and engagement
- Include meaningful interaction (critique, expansion, evaluation)
- Require at least one per week in most courses

**Instructor Expectations:**
- Discussion prompts should be open-ended, allowing for multiple valid responses
- Prompts should create space for disagreement, nuance, and alternative approaches
- Clear instructions on post format, length, and response expectations
- Rubrics or grading guidance that rewards critical engagement, not just participation
- Initial posts should demonstrate engagement with content or evidence
- Response posts should advance discussion (critique, expand, synthesize, evaluate)

**Discussion Topics May Include:**
- Application of theory to real-world scenarios
- Comparison and contrast of concepts or approaches
- Responses to case studies or ethical dilemmas
- Sharing research findings or professional experiences
- Feedback on peer's project components

### 4. Quizzes

**Quizzes** are lower-stakes assessments that check understanding and reinforce learning.

**Characteristics:**
- Generally worth fewer points than major assignments or projects
- Can be used formatively (to provide feedback) or summatively (to assess mastery)
- Varied formats (multiple choice, true/false, short answer, essay)
- May or may not be required; depends on course design
- Often used for topics requiring memorization or factual recall

**Instructor Expectations:**
- Questions directly assess course content and outcomes
- Mix of question types appropriate to learning objectives
- Clear, unambiguous question wording
- Correct answers provided and answer keys available
- If essay-style, rubrics provide clear grading guidance
- Low stakes encourage honest assessment without high stress

**Quiz Formats:**
- Knowledge checks (did students understand the reading?)
- Scenario-based questions (applying knowledge to situations)
- Mastery quizzes (checking key concepts)
- Reflection quizzes (checking depth of thinking)

## Media and Instructor Expectations

Media in Unity courses includes videos, images, diagrams, interactive elements, and other multimedia content.

**Standards for Media Quality:**
- **Accessibility** - All media includes captions, transcripts, alt text, or descriptions
- **Technical Quality** - Clear audio and video; professional appearance
- **Relevance** - Every piece of media directly supports learning outcomes
- **Consistency** - Branding, length, and style are consistent across the course
- **Functionality** - All links and embedded media work; no broken connections

**Types of Media in Courses:**
- **Instructor-Created Videos** - Week overviews, content explanations, feedback videos
- **Learning Videos** - Subject-matter content from vetted external sources
- **Simulations and Interactive Tools** - Labster, Canva, ArcGIS, software demonstrations
- **Graphics and Diagrams** - Infographics, concept maps, process flows
- **Images** - Course header images, illustration, examples

**SME Role with Media:**
- Recommending credible, accessible video sources
- Creating scripts or outlines for instructor-recorded content
- Providing accurate, field-standard graphics and diagrams
- Reviewing media for accuracy and appropriateness
- Recording or preparing videos as contracted

## Learning Materials

**Learning Materials** are the curated resources students use to develop knowledge and skills. These typically include readings, videos, websites, datasets, or other resources.

**Characteristics:**
- Directly aligned to course outcomes
- Curated (selected from quality sources, not exhaustive)
- Appropriate level for students (not too advanced or too basic)
- Mix of modalities (reading, video, interactive, hands-on)
- Accessible (properly attributed, within fair use, available to all students)

**Types of Learning Materials:**
- Journal articles (peer-reviewed research)
- Book chapters (textbooks or academic works)
- Videos (educational content, documentaries, expert interviews)
- Websites and interactive resources (galleries, databases, tools)
- Open Educational Resources (OER)
- Datasets or case studies

**Instructor Expectations:**
- Materials are essential to completing graded activities, not supplementary
- Clear navigation to materials (organized by week or topic)
- Brief introductions explaining why material is valuable
- Proper citations and attribution
- Copyright compliance (fair use or licensed content)
- If paywalled, materials must be accessible through library or provided by instructor
