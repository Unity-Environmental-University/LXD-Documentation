# Development Timeline and Milestones

## Overview

Course development at Unity DE typically takes **8-16 weeks** depending on course credit hours. While the exact timeline is customized for each SME-LXD partnership, all courses follow the same major milestones and approval gates.

### Timeline by Course Credit

| Credit Hours | Typical Duration | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1-credit course | 8-10 weeks | Shorter course; fewer outcomes, components, and materials |
| 2-credit course | 10-12 weeks | Standard development timeline |
| 3-credit course | 12-16 weeks | More complex; more outcomes, graded activities, and materials |

**Note:** Timelines can extend if significant revisions are requested, and may compress if the SME and LXD work very efficiently.

## Major Milestones and Gates

All courses proceed through these key approval points, where the Dean or faculty stakeholders review progress and approve moving forward.

### Milestone 1: Course Outcomes Approval (Week 1-2)

**What Happens:**
- SME and LXD meet to discuss course vision, scope, and learning goals
- LXD shares the course description and program outcomes
- SME drafts 4-6 course-level outcomes aligned to program outcomes
- LXD provides feedback on outcome clarity and alignment

**Deliverables:**
- Final Course Outcomes (clearly written, measurable, "Students will be able to...")
- Alignment document linking course outcomes to program outcomes

**Dean Review:**
- Dean reviews outcomes for rigor, alignment, and feasibility
- Dean approves or requests revision

**Next Steps:**
- Proceed to Course Project development

### Milestone 2: Course Project Approval (Week 3-4)

**What Happens:**
- SME and LXD brainstorm the capstone Course Project
- SME describes an authentic, real-world deliverable from their field
- LXD helps shape the project to be feasible and scaffoldable
- Project components and assessment strategy are outlined

**Deliverables:**
- Course Project Overview (description, audience, learning value)
- Project components and how they scaffold across the term
- Rubric or assessment criteria (in draft form)

**Dean Review:**
- Dean assesses project quality, authenticity, and rigor
- Dean approves or requests changes to project scope

**Next Steps:**
- Begin drafting course structure and graded activities

---

### Milestone 3: Draft Course Design Review (Week 5-8)

**What Happens:**
- SME creates draft assignments, discussions, and quizzes
- LXD provides iterative feedback on alignment, clarity, and feasibility
- SME records draft videos or media assets
- Weekly alignment check: Does each activity clearly support outcomes?

**Deliverables:**
- Draft of all graded activities (assignments, discussions, quizzes) with instructions and rubrics
- List of learning materials (readings, videos, external resources)
- Draft Course Project components and rubric

**Dean Review:**
- Dean reviews content rigor and alignment
- Dean may request content changes or additional assessments

**Next Steps:**
- Finalize activities based on feedback
- Compile and organize learning materials
- Build course in Canvas

---

### Milestone 4: Quality Assurance (QA) Review (Week 9-16)

**What Happens:**
- LXD builds course in Canvas using standardized template
- SME is assigned QA role in Canvas
- SME reviews entire course for accuracy, functionality, and completeness (1 week)
- SME checks all links, videos, discussions, rubrics, and gradebook setup
- LXD makes corrections based on QA feedback

**Deliverables:**
- Fully built Canvas course
- QA checklist completed by SME
- All errors and broken links fixed

**Dean Review:**
- Dean does final sign-off that course is complete and ready for delivery

**Next Steps:**
- Course moves to Blueprint for replication
- Instructor preparation and support materials created

## Weekly Rhythm During Development

Throughout the development process, the SME and LXD follow a consistent weekly workflow:

### Before Each Meeting (2-3 days prior)

The SME completes assignments from the previous meeting:
- Draft assignments, discussions, or course project components
- Research and compile learning materials
- Record videos or media
- Send work to LXD for review (24 hours before meeting for feedback)

### During Weekly Meetings (1-2 hours)

SME and LXD:
- Discuss SME's completed work and LXD feedback
- Plan next week's priorities
- Clarify course design decisions together
- Address questions or concerns

### After Each Meeting

LXD:
- Provides written feedback on SME's next assignment
- Tracks progress toward milestones

SME:
- Completes work by agreed deadline
- Comes prepared to next meeting to discuss feedback and revisions

---

## Time Commitment Expectations

Development requires significant time beyond weekly meetings:

**SME Time Expectations:**
- 1-2 weekly meetings: **2-4 hours**
- Homework assignments (writing, researching, recording): **4-10 hours/week**
- Revisions and QA review: **2-4 hours/week**
- **Total: 8-18 hours/week for 8-16 weeks**

This varies based on:
- Experience writing online course content
- Complexity of the course
- Quality of first drafts (fewer revisions needed = less time)
- Media creation (recording videos takes time)

**Communication Expectations:**
- Check Unity email daily; respond within 36 hours
- Use Google Drive for all shared documents (not personal email attachments)
- Flag roadblocks or scheduling conflicts early so LXD can adjust timelines

---

## Typical Weekly Schedule

Here's what a typical week might look like:

| Day | Activity |
|---|---|
| Mon-Wed | SME works on assignments from previous meeting |
| Wed | SME sends completed work to LXD for review |
| Thu | LXD reviews and provides written feedback |
| Fri or Mon | SME and LXD meet to discuss feedback and plan next week |
| After meeting | LXD provides new assignment for following week |

## What If I Fall Behind?

If you're struggling to complete work by deadlines:

1. **Reach out early** - Contact your LXD BEFORE the due date, not after
2. **Identify the blocker** - Are you unclear on the task? Stuck on content? Personal commitment?
3. **Adjust the plan** - Your LXD can prioritize differently or adjust meetings
4. **Move forward** - Your LXD wants to help you succeed; communication prevents course delays

---

## Approval Chain for All Changes

Throughout development, remember this approval structure:

- **You (SME)** create the content
- **LXD** reviews for pedagogical soundness and alignment
- **Dean** reviews at major milestones for academic rigor and curriculum fit
- **Students** ultimately benefit from a well-designed course

Everyone has a role, and clear communication keeps the process moving smoothly.
