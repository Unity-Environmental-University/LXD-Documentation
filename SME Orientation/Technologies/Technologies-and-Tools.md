# Technologies and Tools

## Overview

Course development at Unity DE relies on a suite of tools that support collaboration, content creation, and course delivery. As an SME, you'll use these tools to create content and work with your LXD team.

## Google Drive - Your Primary Workspace

**Google Drive** is the central hub for all course development collaboration. All SMEs receive a Unity account that provides access to shared Google workspaces.

### Why Google Drive?

- **Real-time collaboration** - You and your LXD can edit documents simultaneously
- **Version control** - Never worry about losing work; automatic version history
- **Comments and suggestions** - Give and receive feedback without overwriting original content
- **Organization** - All course materials in one shared folder structure
- **Accessibility** - Access from any device; no software installation needed

### Google Drive Structure for Your Course

Your course development folder typically includes:

```
Course Name (Shared Folder)
├── Course Outcomes
├── Assignments & Discussions (with rubrics)
├── Course Project Materials
├── Learning Materials (reading lists, links, PDFs)
├── Videos (notes, scripts, transcripts)
├── Meeting Notes
├── Feedback & Revisions
└── Final Course Assets (for Canvas)
```

### Best Practices

✓ **Use Unity credentials** to access Drive (not personal Gmail)
✓ **Comment, don't overwrite** - Use "Suggestion" mode when the LXD might revise your work
✓ **Save early and often** - Autosave works, but manually saving avoids confusion
✓ **Use clear naming conventions** - Example: "Week3_Discussion_DRAFT_v1"
✓ **Check permissions** - Ensure LXD and Dean can view/edit what they need
✓ **Avoid email attachments** - Share files in Drive instead of email

## Canvas - Your Course Home

**Canvas** is the Learning Management System (LMS) where your course will ultimately live and where students will interact with it.

### SME Access to Canvas

- You'll receive access to a **DEV (Development) course** where you can see examples and test content
- You'll receive access to the **Development/Build version** of your own course
- You may have access to a **SAMPLE course** showing best practices

### Canvas Elements You'll Work With

| Element | Your Role | Who Controls |
|---|---|---|
| **Pages** | Create/edit content pages for lessons | SME creates, LXD reviews |
| **Assignments** | Write instructions, create rubrics | SME creates, LXD edits |
| **Discussions** | Write discussion prompts and rubrics | SME creates, LXD edits |
| **Quizzes** | Create questions and answer keys | SME creates, LXD edits |
| **Gradebook** | Understand how it will be set up | LXD sets up based on your activities |
| **Media** | Upload or embed videos, images, files | Both; LXD manages organization |

### Important Canvas Notes

- You don't need to be a Canvas expert; the LXD handles most technical setup
- Your role is creating content that the LXD will organize and structure
- Questions about Canvas functionality? Ask your LXD
- All content should be clear enough that a different instructor could teach it

## Additional Tools You May Use

### Video Recording & Editing

You may be asked to create instructor-recorded videos for course overviews or content explanations.

**Video Guidelines:**
- **Length:** 5-15 minutes (typically)
- **Format:** MP4 or similar widely-compatible format
- **Quality:** Clear audio, steady camera, professional appearance
- **Content:** Script provided or approved by LXD beforehand
- **Captions:** Required; can be auto-generated then reviewed

**Tools for Recording:**
- Zoom (built-in recording)
- Screencast-O-Matic
- OBS Studio

- (Your LXD can recommend based on needs)

### Curating External Media

You'll identify videos, simulations, and other external resources for students.

**Criteria for External Media:**
- ✓ Reputable source (university, professional organization, publisher)
- ✓ Current and accurate information
- ✓ Accessible (captions, transcripts if available)
- ✓ Appropriate for student level
- ✓ Legally available (no pirated content)
- ✗ Avoid paywalled content unless students have library access

**Common Resources:**
- YouTube educational channels
- [Labster simulations](https://www.labster.com) (for STEM)
- [Kanopy](https://www.kanopy.com) (documentaries, films)
- University library databases
- Publisher resources (textbook companions)
- Open Educational Resources (OER)

### Collaboration Tools

Depending on your course, you may use:

- **Google Workspace** - Drive, Docs, Slides, Sheets
- **Zoom** - Weekly meetings with LXD
- **Email (Unity account)** - Communication with LXD and Dean
- **Canvas** - Viewing your developing course

## Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Course Development

### AI for SMEs: Opportunities and Guidelines

AI tools can assist in course development, but with important guardrails around academic integrity and quality.

#### ✓ Acceptable Uses of AI

**Content Support:**
- Brainstorming assignment ideas or discussion prompts
- Generating multiple versions of assignment instructions for LXD to choose from
- Summarizing research or creating reading guides
- Creating study guides or study question lists
- Drafting timelines or project schedules

**Workflow Efficiency:**
- Organizing and outlining complex content
- Creating tables of contents or hierarchical outlines
- Formatting or organizing already-written content
- Translating jargon into simpler language
- Proofreading for grammar and clarity

**Learning Preparation:**
- Asking AI to explain concepts to identify gaps in your explanation
- Generating practice questions or test items for review
- Creating analogies or real-world examples

#### ✗ Unacceptable Uses

**Prohibited:**
- Using AI-generated text as your own without significant editing
- Allowing AI to write course content that you don't deeply understand or review
- Using AI to replace your expertise or personal voice
- Submitting AI-generated materials without disclosure to your LXD
- Creating assignment or quiz questions that students can't solve without AI

**Red Flags:**
- Content that sounds "generic" or impersonal
- Explanations that miss important nuances of your field
- Examples that don't reflect current professional practice
- Content that doesn't match your teaching voice or style

#### Best Practices with AI

1. **Use AI as an assistant, not an author** - You remain the content creator
2. **Always review and edit** - AI-generated text needs your expert judgment
3. **Be transparent** - Tell your LXD if you used AI assistance
4. **Maintain academic integrity** - Don't use AI to do what students should do
5. **Verify accuracy** - AI can make convincing-sounding errors; fact-check
6. **Preserve your voice** - Heavily edit AI content so it sounds like you

### AI for Students: Expectations and Policies

#### AI in Assignments

Students will encounter AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) in their daily lives. Courses should:

- **Explicitly state policies** - Is AI use allowed? Restricted? Prohibited?
- **Match assignment design** - Activities should be hard to fake with AI when appropriate
- **Teach responsible use** - Help students understand when AI is useful vs. problematic
- **Focus on skills** - Design assessments around things AI can't do alone (analysis, synthesis, professional judgment)

#### Common Policy Approaches

**AI Prohibited:**
- Writing final essays or reports
- Answering quiz questions
- Creating discussion posts without significant original thought

**AI Allowed with Disclosure:**
- Using AI to brainstorm ideas, then writing yourself
- Using AI to check your work (like a spell-checker)
- Using AI as a learning tool (ask it to explain concepts)
- Editing AI-generated text into something original

**AI Encouraged:**
- Using AI to research or brainstorm
- Using professional AI tools relevant to your field (like data analysis tools)
- Learning how AI works in your discipline

#### Discussion with Your LXD

Your LXD will help you develop AI policies that:
- Align to your course learning outcomes
- Maintain academic integrity
- Prepare students for professional practice (where they'll encounter AI)
- Are clear to students and easy to monitor

## A Note on Technology

**Technology is a tool, not the goal.** The goal is learning. We select tools that:
- Support collaboration and real-world practice
- Remove barriers for online learners
- Are accessible and reliable
- Enhance (not complicate) instruction

If a tool isn't serving these purposes, we find a better one.

Your LXD is your technology guide. Don't hesitate to ask questions!
