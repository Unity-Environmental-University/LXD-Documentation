# What to expect when SMEing a Unity DE course

First, thank you for being the Subject Matter Expert (SME) for Unity DE. Your
expertise is invaluable, and we are excited to work with you! This website will give
you some specifics on the process and expectations of a new course development. This page
is a condensed intro to the basic concepts. 

## Your role

Your role as the SME is to help develop the course by creating and
shaping the content. The role of the LD is to function as the project manager, to help
you plan, refine, and edit the content you create.

As a SME contracted to create unique course content, you're expected to write and
record original material for the Unity courses you develop. You cannot recycle material
that you, or anyone else, uses elsewhere, including other courses at Unity. Please don't
copy and paste; we take pride in our courses as unique published work.

<warning>Evidence of plagiarism will result in dismissal from the project.</warning>

## The role of Learning Designers

Once your contract with Unity has been signed, you will receive an email from the
Assistant Director of Learning Experience Design. This email will include the Learning
Designer (LD) assigned to work with you. The LD is the project manager of the development,
and is an adult learning expert. They are responsible for the final published version of 
the course and the intentional application of andragogy to its design. One way to think
about your role relative to theirs is you are an author, and they are your editor. 

## The role of Deans and Assistant Deans

The Dean(s) overseeing the development are responsible for the curriculum of which the course
is a piece. They will check in at regular intervals, defined in the timeline for your development. 
At certain milestones in the development they're asked to comment directly on the course content and
either approve or request it be reworked. 

## Communication Expectations
 
As a SME for Unity Environmental University, you are provided with a Unity email account and Google Drive access. During the development, please use your Unity credentials to access both email and relevant documents within Google Drive rather than your personal email. 
If you are struggling to complete the assigned tasks by the due date you determined with the learning designer because you're feeling confused or stuck, please reach out to the designer prior to your next meeting. If you are unable to complete assigned tasks because of personal commitments, please also reach out; this allows the learning designer to plan ahead for best use of your meeting time. 
Additionally, please check your Unity email frequently and respond within 36 hours; even though you meet 1-2x weekly, the learning designer you’re working with may have questions or information to convey that requires a timely response.

## Before Your First Meeting - How to Prepare

To make your first meeting productive, review these materials and come ready to discuss:

### Course Outcomes and Alignment

The kick-off email you receive will contain:
- **Course Description** - What the course covers
- **Course Outcomes** - What students should be able to do at the end of the course (these may be draft; you'll refine them)
- **Program Outcomes for Conceptual Development** - Broader degree goals your course supports
- **Program Outcomes to be Directly Assessed** - Key skills that students must demonstrate in this course (usually measured by a major assignment or project)

**What to do:**
1. **Read everything carefully** - Understand the scope and goals
2. **Identify gaps** - What's missing from the course description? What should students definitely learn?
3. **Think about assessment** - How will students prove they can do what the outcomes claim?
4. **Bring questions** - Jot down anything unclear or that you disagree with

### Understanding Bloom's Taxonomy

At Unity, all course outcomes and activities are intentionally designed to move students up **Bloom's Taxonomy** - from basic knowledge to higher-order thinking.

**Bloom's Levels (in order of complexity):**
1. **Remember** - Define, recognize, recall facts
2. **Understand** - Explain, summarize, classify
3. **Apply** - Use information in new situations, solve problems
4. **Analyze** - Distinguish parts, find relationships, breakdown components
5. **Evaluate** - Defend judgments, critique approaches, justify decisions
6. **Create** - Combine elements in new ways, design solutions

**At Unity, we emphasize Levels 3-6.** Your assignments and Course Project should push students beyond mere recall toward analysis, evaluation, and creation.

**Resources to review before your first meeting:**
- [Bloom's Taxonomy Guide](https://www.cebm.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Blooms-Taxonomy-Teacher-Planning-Kit.pdf) (includes level descriptors and action verbs)
- [Webb's Depth of Knowledge](https://www.aps.edu/sapr/documents/resources/Webbs_DOK_Guide.pdf) (another framework for thinking about cognitive complexity)

**Questions to ask yourself:**
- What is the highest level of Bloom's that students need to reach in this course?
- How will assignments help students climb the levels progressively?
- Does my Course Project require students to create or evaluate (not just apply or understand)?

### Brainstorm Your Course Project

Begin thinking about what authentic, real-world deliverable students could produce in your course. Some questions to consider:

**What does a professional in your field actually produce?**
- A report? A proposal? A design? A presentation?
- An analysis? A plan? A product evaluation? A research study?

**What would be meaningful for students to work on?**
- Something they could actually use in their career?
- A deliverable they could include in a portfolio?
- A genuine problem they'd encounter in professional practice?

**What would be feasible in an online, asynchronous course?**
- Can students do it without face-to-face collaboration?
- Can they complete components progressively (scaffolded)?
- Can it be assessed fairly and consistently?

**Bring 1-3 Course Project ideas to your first meeting.** Your LXD will help you refine these and develop one into the capstone assessment.

### Gather Example Materials and Resources

Start collecting materials you might use in the course:
- **Readings** - Journal articles, book chapters, reports
- **Videos** - Educational videos or documentaries relevant to content
- **Tools** - Software, simulations, or platforms students might use
- **Authentic Examples** - Real-world documents, projects, or case studies from your field
- **Datasets** - Data students could analyze or work with

You don't need everything gathered, but having a sense of what's available helps your first meeting discussion.

## The development
1. Please read the Course Description, Course Outcomes, and Program Outcomes
   for Conceptual Development, as this will give you an idea of what students will be
   expected to be able to do upon completing the course.
2. The LD will contact you to set up the first meeting via TEAMS videochat.
3. First meeting: this is a “get to know you” video conference, but it will also be the
   time to set the calendar for the 8-16 weeks (8-10 for a 1-credit new build; 10-12
   for a 2-credit new build; 12-16 for a 3-credit new build) and follow up on this
   overview. SMEs and LDs meet at least once a week, but this can be arranged
   between the two of you. As well, it is a perfect opportunity to ask the LD
   questions.
4. Adding you to a Development Course. The LD may add you to a course to see
   what example assignments, discussions, quizzes, instructions, overviews,
   Course Project, etc. look like. It is also a good time to get to know how our
   courses function in our compressed terms.
5. Backward Design: Good course development starts with understanding the
   Course Outcomes, which list what we want the students to be able to do when
   they leave the course. So, when building the course, it is best to start from where
   you want students to end up and move backwards. As you move from the big
   picture to the details, think about how the assignments help students achieve
   those outcomes
6. Course Project: Unity College Distance Education works hard to provide
   hands-on, real-world opportunities to assess students. Each course has a well-developed course project, the final deliverable of which is due at the end of the
   term. Earlier Course Project deliverables are collected in weekly assignments, a
   process called “scaffolding,” in a way designed to promote student success. Your
   LD will help you with this.
   - Usually in the first meeting, you and the LD brainstorm on a course project
   as described above.
   - The SME will be expected to provide examples of authentic artifacts,
   products, or processes from their discipline that form the basis of the
   Course Project.
7. SME Homework: You will be creating, writing, and completing assignments
   that align to the course project, sometimes directly, and sometimes the
   assignments will indirectly align. Each week you and the LD will decide what
   needs to be prepared for the following meeting. Expect to have weekly
   homework outside of development meetings.
8. Time Commitment: Please spend time looking at sample assignments in the
   Development Course or documents that have been shared with you. Notice, in
   particular, the depth and specificity of assignment directions. Writing these takes
   time, but that time pays off in the efficiency with which the course runs. When you
   and the LD agree to a certain amount of work that needs to be done prior to the
   next development meeting, that work is expected to be completed one day prior
   to that meeting so the LD can review it prior to your next meeting.
9. Assignments Categories: In Canvas, all student activities that are assessed,
   fall under the category of Assignments; however, there are 3 separate
   Assignments that nest beneath this category: Assignments, Discussions, and
   Quizzes.
   - Assignments: You will design and write the description and steps
   students follow for each assignment. Unlike in face-to-face courses,
   students will only have these pages to go by, so assignment directions
   must be thorough and complete without requiring further context or
   explanation. These explicit instructions will help determine what is
   necessary for the rubric.
   - Discussions: At least one discussion is required each week. These will
   also need written descriptions and instructions. Discussions require an
   initial post and at least 2 responses to other students' posts.
   - Quizzes: Quizzes are generally low stakes, and can be created using a
   variety of formats, including Multiple Choice, Short Answer, True/False,
   Essay Questions etc. These are not required, but if you create a quiz, you
   will also be expected to include the answers.
   - Labs: Some courses require students to complete lab activities (hands-on
   or virtual) to gain experience with certain techniques or practices. You may
   review the catalog of [Labster Simulations](https://www.labster.com/simulations) (a 3rd party software)
   or another platform.
   - Video Recordings: You will be required to record yourself on camera
   discussing an overview of the week's material and/or specific content

<note>You may, or may not, be one of the instructors teaching the course when it runs.</note>
