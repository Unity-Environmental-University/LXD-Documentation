# Course Project Pre-Approval Template

Use this template to organize your thinking about the Course Project **before your first meeting** with your Learning Designer. You don't need to fill this out perfectly—it's a brainstorming tool. But thinking through these questions will make your first meeting much more productive.

---

## Course Project Brainstorm

### Project Title/Name
*(What will you call this project?)*

Example: "Environmental Management Plan," "Grant Proposal," "Lab Report"

---

### Real-World Context

**What authentic problem or task does this project simulate?**

Example: "In reality, environmental consultants develop management plans for specific locations to address ecological issues. Students will develop a management plan for a local ecosystem of their choice."

---

### The Deliverable(s)

**What will students actually produce?** (Be specific)

Examples:
- Written report (how long? what format? what sections?)
- Presentation (how long? to what audience? what format?)
- Visual/Digital component (website? infographic? video? proposal slides?)
- Physical product (design? model? prototype?)
- Combination of above

**Description:**

---

### Project Outcomes

**Which course outcomes does this project allow students to demonstrate?**

List the 3-4 most important course outcomes that students will show through this project.

Example:
- Students will be able to analyze environmental data and identify patterns
- Students will be able to synthesize information from multiple sources
- Students will be able to propose evidence-based solutions
- Students will be able to communicate scientific findings to non-expert audiences

---

### Authentic Alignment

**Why would a professional in your field actually do this?**

Explain why this deliverable matters in real professional practice. What's the authentic value?

Example: "Environmental managers regularly develop management plans because they need written, documented strategies to implement changes, secure funding, and communicate with stakeholders."

---

### Scaffolding Plan

**How will students build this project throughout the course?**

Don't make the entire project due at the end. Instead, break it into components due progressively. This allows time for feedback and builds skills incrementally.

Example structure:
- **Week 1:** Project overview & choose a topic
- **Week 2:** Literature review assignment (research sources)
- **Week 3:** Data analysis assignment (analyze environmental data)
- **Week 4:** Discussion (share preliminary findings with peers)
- **Week 5:** Draft proposal (written component)
- **Week 6-7:** Revision and feedback
- **Week 8:** Final project submission

**Your scaffolding plan:**

| Week | Component | What students do |
|---|---|---|
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |

### Assessment Rubric (Sketch)

**How will you know if students did it well?**

Don't write a detailed rubric yet—your LXD will help with that. But think about what excellence looks like.

**Criteria for success:**
- *(Example: Clear organization, appropriate evidence, professional tone)*
-
-
-

---

### Student Choice/Customization

**How much choice will students have?**

- Can they choose their own topic or case study?
- Can they choose the format (written vs. presentation)?
- Are there constraints to keep projects comparable?

Example: "Students choose their own local ecosystem to study, but all must follow the same section structure and include peer-reviewed sources."

**Your plan:**

---

### Learning Materials & Resources Needed

**What will students need to complete this project?**

- Required readings (journal articles, book chapters)?
- Videos or tutorials?
- Data or datasets?
- Software or tools?
- Examples of "professional quality" projects?

**List them:**

---

### Feasibility Check

**Can students complete this in an online, asynchronous course?**

Consider:
- ✓ Can it be done without face-to-face collaboration?
- ✓ Can students work on it on their own schedule?
- ✓ Are all necessary resources available online?
- ✓ Can it be assessed fairly and consistently?

**Any concerns to discuss with your LXD?**

---

### Questions for Your LXD

**What do you want to ask your LXD about this project?**

Examples:
- "Is this scope realistic for an 8-week course?"
- "How much instructor feedback time would this require?"
- "Would students be capable of this by week 4?"
- "Is there a tool that would help students with the visual component?"

**Your questions:**

1.
2.
3.

## Tips for Brainstorming

✓ **Think like a professional** - What real work would someone in your field do?

✓ **Make it tangible** - "Develop critical thinking" is vague; "Write a professional report analyzing a case study" is clear

✓ **Allow personalization** - Students stay more engaged when they can apply learning to their own interests

✓ **Build in feedback loops** - Break the project into pieces so students can get feedback before the final submission

✓ **Keep it authentic** - If no one in your field would actually do this, rethink it

✓ **Consider the workload** - This is the capstone; it's substantial, but it can't be the only thing students do

## When to Submit This

You don't need to formally submit this template before your first meeting. Instead:
- **Bring notes** (this template or your own notes) to your first meeting
- **Come ready to discuss** your project ideas
- **Be prepared for feedback** - Your LXD may suggest refinements or alternatives

Your LXD will help you turn your initial ideas into a polished Course Project Approval document after your first meeting.
