## Course Design at Unity

> **Duration:** 15-20 minutes

Learn about the philosophy behind course development at Unity DE, including backwards design, the iterative nature of course maintenance, and credit hour requirements.

### Overview / Script:
Our course development philosophy is to be intentional and coordinated, even as we innovate and differentiate and give people space to experiment and play. This is a balance we constantly adjust for and will never get perfectly right. But the process is, itself, permenantly iterated upon. We speed some things up, slow other things down, and remove or replace entire steps in the process. Note, too, that depending on the SEBU (GRAD, BACC, Career Edge, etc.) the process may look very different. But the philosophy is always the same.

You'll read a bit about Backwards Design in this section's materials, Course Projects, and inclusivity. The org anizing principle for all of those subjects is that we have a team of experts in adult learning who are charged with managing course developments and ensuring that the resulting courses are up to our standards. In the eyes of the institution, they are co-equal with the faculty to specialize in the subject(s) for which we're designing these courses, and that useful tension - between subject-matter-expert and androgogical-learning-at-Unity expert - is what makes it possible for us to enroll students from all walks of life, while pushing rigor, while innovating with tools and exciting new technologies, while keeping tuition lower than any of our competitors, while achieving retention rates that exceed any of our competitors. 

So: Please recognize that the Learning Designer assigned to you is an expert, a resource, and the project manager for the course development to which you've been assigned. Much of what is covered in this section of the Orientation is stuff they will constantly be adjusting for and guiding toward throughout the development. 

**Key Concepts:**
- Outcomes-focused course design
- Course maintenance and iterative development
- Credit hour requirements for undergraduate and graduate courses

**Key Files:**
- [Course Design at Unity](Course%20Design/Course-Design.md)
- [Course Project Philosophy](Course%20Design/Course-Project-Philosophy.md)
- [Equity and Inclusivity in Course Design](Course%20Design/Equity-and-Inclusivity-Considerations-for-LXD-Designing-Courses.md)

**Reflection Questions:**
- What does "backwards design" mean to you?
- How do you currently think about measuring student learning?
- What real-world deliverables exist in your field?

## Your Role and Authority

> **Duration:** 10-15 minutes

Understand your role as a Subject Matter Expert, the Learning Experience Designer's role, and the Dean's authority in course development. Clarity on roles prevents confusion and keeps development moving smoothly.

### Overview / Script
In your role as Subject Matter Expert, your responsibility is to dream big about what's possible in guiding inquisitive minds through your area of expertise. Yes, it's essential that the content be both accurate and relevant to what the Dean intends for the course (it needs to fit into the larger curriculum). But honestly it's not too difficult, in most subject areas, regarding most skills, to research and re-create the common path learners take in analogous courses. What we *can't* do, without your help, is imagine new, better, more compelling or relevant ways to teach the course. The Dean and/or LXD working with you on the course may push back or even veto some of your ideas, but it's always better to work from a coherent, passionate vision for what the course could be than from 

The Dean will set, maintain, and continuously adjust the frame for the course: Course description, outcomes, the intended function of the course in the larger curriculum. 

The LXD will oversee the development timeline, the androgogical principles, any "shadow curriculum" issues, decisions about new tools or technologies versus tried and true options. etc. 

**You** bring experience in the field and the irreplaceable ability to think creatively, from a place of authority, about ways to teach students about said field. So please dream big, and come to the meetings with your LXD with ideas for the course. Much of their job is figuring out how to make your vision possible. Just keep in mind that we are decisive about what is good for our students and what we can support, so even some amazing ideas just aren't possible. But we'll do our best if you can do yours. 

**Key Concepts:**
- SME vs. LXD responsibilities
- LXD has development authority
- Dean has ultimate authority and veto power
- Collaborative decision-making in practice

**Key Files:**
- [Role, Scope, and Authority](Roles/Role-Scope-and-Authority.md)
- [Intellectual Property](Roles/Intellectual-Property.md)

**Reflection Questions:**
- What questions do you have about your role?
- What decisions do you expect to make? Which ones do you expect your LXD to make?
- What would you do if you disagreed with an LXD decision?

## Course Components and Alignment

> **Duration:** 25-35 minutes

Understand how all course elements—outcomes, graded activities, learning materials, and media—work together to support student learning.

### Overview / Script
Courses at Unity Environmental University are very regular in structure, which is only possible because we have exacting standards for how 

**Key Concepts:**
- The alignment chain from program outcomes to daily activities
- Four types of graded activities: Course Projects, Assignments, Discussions, and Quizzes
- Instructor expectations for quality and rigor
- Media and learning materials standards

**Key Files:**
- [Components Overview](Course%20Components/Components-Overview.md) (comprehensive)
- [Assignments and Discussions](Course%20Components/Assignments-and-Discussions.md)
- [Course Projects](Course%20Design/Course-Project-Philosophy.md)

**Reflection Questions:**
- How do the assignments you currently create align to learning outcomes?
- What activities in your field are most authentic? How could they become assessments?
- How would you scaffold a complex skill across an 8-week course?

## Technologies and Tools

> **Duration:** 15-20 minutes

Learn about the technology stack you'll use during development: Google Drive, Canvas, video recording tools, and guidelines for AI use.

**Key Concepts:**
- Google Drive as your collaboration hub
- Canvas as the course delivery platform
- Video recording and external media curation
- Appropriate and inappropriate uses of AI in course development
- AI policies for students

**Key Files:**
- [Technologies and Tools](Technologies/Technologies-and-Tools.md)
- [Google Drive](Technologies/Google-Drive.md)

**Reflection Questions:**
- Are you comfortable with Google Drive and Canvas?
- Do you have experience recording video? If not, what support do you need?
- What are your thoughts about AI in education?

## Development Timeline

> **Duration:** 15-20 minutes

Understand the development process from start to finish, including major milestones, approval gates, weekly workflows, and time commitment expectations.

**Key Concepts:**
- Timeline varies by course credit and SEBU (8-16 weeks)
- Four major milestones with Dean approval gates
- Weekly rhythm and meeting expectations
- Time commitment: 8-18 hours per week
- What to do if you fall behind

**Key Files:**
